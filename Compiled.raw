When I was 8 years old, my family moved to Colorado, a place where our neighbors were predominantly white. My parents didn't introduce me to anyone who looked like me, and the few encounters I had with black individuals through church didn't reflect the societal differences I'd later come to understand. As a young boy, I didn't fully grasp the complexities of race and identity. I lived in a world where everyone around me was different from what I saw in the mirror.


One significant distinction in my life was the religious background I was raised in. My family followed the Church of Christ, a faith community known for its a capella worship and conservative doctrine. But on that particular Sunday morning, my parents decided to take me to my grandfather's Baptist church. Baptists were different in so many ways – their lively hymns, fervent sermons, and a freedom in worship that I had never witnessed in my own church. It was the first glimpse into a world that contrasted sharply with my upbringing, and little did I know, it would lead to an eye-opening experience that would shape my understanding of identity and culture.


One Sunday morning, after several visits to my grandfather's Baptist church, I realized that I was different from the other kids in the congregation. They had a lively spirit, and I couldn't help but be drawn into their animated praise and worship. But when I tried to join in, I felt like an outsider. My reserved Church of Christ upbringing clashed with the exuberance of the Baptist community.


As I attempted to participate, my actions, the way I spoke, and even my mannerisms didn't align with what was considered "normal" in that Baptist congregation. It became apparent that my behavior marked me as an outsider. In a moment that would stay with me for years, the entire church seemed to dismiss me, as if I was an oddity not to be taken seriously. It was my first experience of being labeled a "coon" by those who didn't understand the nuances of my upbringing.


This eye-opening experience shook me to my core, making me acutely aware of how whiteness was reflected not just in the faces around me but also in the way people expected me to act. It was a defining moment in my journey toward understanding my identity and the challenges that lay ahead.


Desperate to fit in, I adopted a new persona. I dressed exclusively in baby blue, earning the nickname "Playboy" within the black community. Initially, I didn't view it as a negative term; in my mind, it symbolized being well-groomed and fashionable. However, within their community, "pretty boy" had a different connotation - it meant I was perceived as soft. As I transitioned into my teenage years, I tried my best to embrace this persona, hoping it would help me gain acceptance.


Gradually, it worked. I was slowly becoming a part of the black community, forging bonds and friendships that brought me a sense of belonging. But there was a significant divide in my life. While I was gaining acceptance in one world, I was inadvertently distancing myself from my white friends who couldn't relate to my evolving identity.


The most challenging part of this transformation was the reaction from my family. They couldn't understand why I was changing, why I was trying so hard to fit into a mold that they didn't recognize. It became a source of tension within my household, as I grappled with the contrasting expectations of my family and my newfound community.


As I continued to explore my identity and seek acceptance within the black community, I found myself in a battle on multiple fronts. My parents viewed my transformation as a direct attack against their conservative Christian morals. The clash between their beliefs and my evolving identity led to harsh confrontations, both mentally and physically. I became the target of their frustration and disappointment, a painful experience that I carried with me.


Even more disheartening was the fact that my parents enlisted my siblings in their disapproval, turning my own family against me. I became an outcast in my own home, isolated and struggling to find a sense of belonging anywhere. The wounds from the mental and physical abuse inflicted by my parents were not just physical; they ran deep, leaving scars on my psyche.


Despite the turmoil at home, my determination to explore my identity and find acceptance in the black community only grew stronger. It was a tumultuous time in my life, one marked by both inner strength and deep pain, as I navigated the complex terrain of self-discovery amidst the adversity of my family's disapproval.


The tension and conflict within my family eventually reached a boiling point, leading to a moment I knew I had to escape. I made the painful decision to run away from home, seeking refuge with my best friend, Stuart. Stuart was a Native American, adopted by an old single white guy. What I experienced during those two weeks living with them would change my entire perspective on acceptance and love.


In Stuart's home, I found a warmth and openness that contrasted sharply with the environment I had left behind. His adopted father, despite being from a different background, welcomed me with open arms. I felt like a part of their family, cherished for who I was, without judgment or expectation. It was a stark contrast to the conflicts and rejection I had faced in my own home.


During that time, I not only learned about the Native American culture but also discovered the power of acceptance and unconditional love. It was a turning point in my life, one that would continue to shape my journey of self-discovery and understanding of the world around me.


The short-lived sanctuary I had found with Stuart and his adopted father was shattered when my parents, with the help of their conservative Christian cop friend, located me at my job. At the age of 14, I had lied on my hen house job application, desperate to make money and assert my independence. The police showed up at my workplace, informed my employer of my true age, and I was summarily fired.


They didn't stop there. They forcibly returned me to my family home, where I endured a severe beating as punishment for my rebellion. The physical and emotional scars from that experience ran deep, a constant reminder of the struggle I faced in trying to reconcile my evolving identity with the expectations and beliefs of my family.


Despite the setbacks and pain, I couldn't ignore the fire that had been ignited within me during my time with Stuart and his family. It was a fire that burned with the desire for acceptance, understanding, and a place where I could be true to myself. This painful chapter in my life only fueled my determination to continue on my path of self-discovery, even in the face of adversity.


Fueled by a burning desire for independence and acceptance, I made the decision to run away once more. This time, I was determined to keep my safe haven a secret from my parents. I found a new job at Popeyes chicken, embracing the opportunity to earn a living and assert my autonomy.


But life has a way of repeating itself, and a few months later, my world came crashing down again. As an abused 15-year-old kid, caught in the crossroads of self-discovery and a search for my roots, I had already endured a lifetime of pain and uncertainty. The challenges I faced at home, the physical and emotional abuse inflicted upon me, were scars etched into my young soul. Yet, despite the turmoil, I couldn't suppress the fire within me, the burning desire to explore my identity and find a place where I truly belonged.


The turning point in my tumultuous journey came when my sister, whether out of concern or misunderstanding, discovered my whereabouts. Her revelation set in motion a chain of events that would forever alter my life. She alerted the police, and in the dead of night, they arrived at Stuart's house, where I had found a brief respite from the turmoil of my past. Handcuffed and bewildered, I was forcibly dragged out of bed, a scared and confused teenager with no understanding of what lay ahead.


They didn't explain their actions or offer reassurance. They didn't tell me where I was going or why. I was handcuffed and left in the dark, both figuratively and literally, about my future. The journey to an uncertain destination had begun, and as a 15-year-old kid, I couldn't have felt more vulnerable. This was a pivotal moment in my quest for self-discovery, where I had to muster every ounce of resilience to face the unknown path that lay ahead.




Vandalia, Missouri, a quaint town where the rhythm of life seemed to move in a slower, more deliberate cadence, etched itself into the tapestry of my life in a way I never could have predicted. Nestled in the heart of the countryside, it was a place where everyone knew everyone else's business, and I, unmistakably, was an outsider. The city boy had landed in this rural idyll, and I quickly realized that I was an exotic rarity in the eyes of my new classmates.


The school I attended in Vandalia had only a handful of black students, and I counted myself among them. However, my urban roots made me stand out like a neon sign in a sea of muted colors. To the country girls, I became something of a status symbol, a tool to elevate their social standing. And, truth be told, I played the part willingly. Being the city kid had its perks, particularly when it came to those legendary bonfires that seemed to define country life.


The bonfires were a ritual, gatherings where stories and laughter intertwined with the flickering flames. I quickly found myself at the center of attention, the city boy who brought a taste of urban life to those small-town soirées. It was almost comical how they'd ask me to recount my "city slicker" stories, hanging on to every word as if they were secrets from a distant, exotic world.


As I navigated the complexities of being one of the few black students in town, I came to realize that I could leverage this newfound attention to my advantage. It was a delicate balancing act, one where I embraced my role as the "city tool" while secretly yearning for a deeper connection with my peers. The bonfires became my stage, and I played my part, finding humor and camaraderie in the midst of our differences.


Little did I know that my time in Vandalia, Missouri, would become a defining chapter in my life, one that would challenge my understanding of identity, belonging, and the intricate dance of fitting into a world that felt both strange and strangely welcoming.


Vandalia, Missouri, was a crucible where teenage life simmered with complexities and tensions. In a town where I was one of the few black students, I stood out like a beacon. There was another black guy there, we'll call him Charles, but our relationship was far from friendly. It was a turbulent mix of jealousy and competition.


The tension between us finally boiled over one evening when Charles, fueled by frustration over a girl who had taken an interest in me, the new kid, decided to take matters into his own hands. He approached me, and without a word, delivered a punch to the back of my head, sending me sprawling. I chose not to retaliate; I didn't want to escalate an already complicated situation, especially with the only other black guy in town. Our connection was strained, to say the least, and navigating the tumultuous waters of teenage life can be a treacherous endeavor.


But amidst the tempest of high school drama, something far more sinister reared its ugly head. News spread like wildfire through the bonfire crowd, my friends rushing to me in hushed tones, conveying the chilling message that a truck was approaching, and its occupants were screaming something haunting: "We're bringing nooses for the N-words."


In that pivotal moment, our differences ceased to matter. Charles and I locked eyes, our unspoken understanding of the gravity of the situation binding us together. Without a second thought, we both turned and ran. In that moment, our shared fear and instinct for survival forged a connection that transcended the petty jealousy that had driven a wedge between us.


The car I used for that ill-fated event belonged to my grandfather, and as the morning sun pierced the horizon, I could almost hear his silent disapproval. My father, Jesse the second, stormed in with a fury that morning, his hands tightening around my neck in a vise grip of anger and frustration.


I fought him off and, clad in nothing but a shirt and boxers, fled to the nearest basketball court. My mind swirled with thoughts, attempting to process the harrowing events of the night and, more urgently, contemplating my next move. The biting cold served as a stark reminder of the harsh realities that loomed over me.


After what felt like an eternity of solitude, my white friend Adam arrived, basketball in hand. I recounted the events of that tumultuous night, and he empathetically lent me a jacket to shield me from the cold. For the rest of the day, I clung to the comfort of his presence, seeking solace in the familiarity of a friend who truly understood.


As night fell, I cautiously returned home, making sure my father's car was no longer there. I knew I needed to have a crucial conversation with my grandfather, a man who proved to be far from the wise patriarch I had hoped for. He was a religious zealot who enforced a rigid routine of thrice-weekly church attendance, each service stretching tortuously over three hours. After school, I was afforded just a solitary hour of free time, the remainder devoted to the ceaseless chores and relentless studying he demanded. The weight of his expectations bore down on me, and I faced the daunting prospect of my impending move to Oklahoma with trepidation.


The drive to Oklahoma was more than a mere physical relocation; it represented a transition into an entirely new chapter of my life. At 15 years old, an age when most teenagers are navigating the labyrinth of high school, forging friendships, and exploring their identities, I found myself thrust into a maelstrom of upheaval, uncertainty, and the quest for a place where I truly belonged.


Sacia, my cousin, and in many ways, my closest confidante during this tumultuous period, took the reins of this journey. She was the anchor that ensured I didn't have to face this daunting transition alone. As we embarked on that open road, leaving behind the remnants of my past life in Missouri, a sense of liberation and hope took hold of me. Perhaps this new beginning in Oklahoma would offer the stability and acceptance I had longed for.


During those miles on the road, our car echoed with laughter and conversation. Sacia and I shared stories, dreams, and even indulged in the occasional off-key rendition of our favorite songs on the radio. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, genuine happiness filled the air. It wasn't someone who had pulled me out of despair during this time; it was the companionship and love that Sacia brought to that car ride, offering a temporary respite from the trials I had endured.


As the miles rolled on and the landscape transformed, I couldn't help but wonder about the uncharted territory ahead. Oklahoma was an unfamiliar canvas, a new place to call home, and an opportunity to redefine myself. Little did I know that this journey would prove to be a pivotal moment in my quest for self-discovery, one that would bring both joy and sorrow, as well as moments of profound connection that would forever shape the person I was destined to become.






Your journey takes a dramatic turn as you cross the Mexican border. Let's continue with your story:


**Chapter 2: The Journey South**


As I sat there, handcuffed to the car, the memories flooded my mind. This was not a joyous car ride with Sacia, but rather a stark reminder of the twists and turns that life can take. How many times in my life had I wished for a moment like that car ride with Sacia to last forever, where the weight of my own struggles was momentarily lifted and carried by somebody else?


We continued driving, heading further south, and the prospect of reaching my sister's house began to fade from my thoughts. The police officer at the wheel remained unwavering, providing no hints about our destination. Time seemed to stretch on as four long hours passed, each minute heavy with uncertainty and anticipation.


Finally, we arrived. All I could see was a clay cement compound, surrounded by green Astroturf and towering walls that reached ten feet high. "Casa by the Sea" was the name of this compound, led by a man named Miguel. Here, any notion of familiarity, of knowing the last names of the people who worked here, was lost in the complexity of my new surroundings.


As I stepped out of the car and into this unknown world, I couldn't help but wonder what awaited me within those high walls. The journey had brought me to a place of profound uncertainty, where I would have to navigate a new culture, a new set of rules, and an entirely different way of life. This chapter of my story was marked by the stark reality of my situation, a stark contrast to the fleeting happiness of that car ride with Sacia, and a stark reminder of the resilience that would be required to face the challenges that lay ahead.

Each morning, the same ritual unfurled—a symphony of waking up and preparing for the day ahead. The uniform, consisting of khaki shorts, a matching khaki shirt, and Styrofoam sandals, served as both a badge of conformity and a stark reminder of the regimented life within those towering walls. It symbolized unity, yet it also whispered of the absence of individuality.
The morning air buzzed with anticipation as you stepped into the foyer, a confined space measuring 20 yards by 20 yards. It was within this contained expanse that you, along with your fellow residents, a diverse group spanning ages 15 to 18, went about your daily existence. They were referred to as "families," where bonds were forged through shared experiences, mutual challenges, and, at times, a sense of camaraderie amid the pervasive atmosphere of adversity.
Within each "family," two appointed family fathers assumed dual roles as both guardians and security enforcers. Their primary task was to maintain order and discipline, ensuring strict adherence to the facility's rules and regulations. Their watchful eyes were an ever-present, ambivalent presence—both a source of security and a reminder of the limitations on your personal freedom.
The role of the family mother, the group therapist, was equally pivotal. She served as the emotional anchor, the guiding light through the labyrinthine corridors of individual and collective trauma. It was she who facilitated group discussions, provided emotional support, and helped residents navigate the turbulent seas of complex emotions that had led them to the threshold of Casa by the Sea. Her presence was a beacon of solace amidst the stark routines, offering a sanctuary for expression and vulnerability in an environment that often perceived vulnerability as a liability.
As you awaited your turn to partake in the morning repast, a swirling mélange of emotions hung in the air—an amalgamation of acknowledgment of the life you led, the rules that governed it, and the continuous challenges that punctuated your existence. Yet, within these seemingly unyielding confines, bonds were woven, support was found, and, perhaps, moments of hope and resilience blossomed amid the unforgiving terrain of adversity.
The morning rhythm flowed seamlessly into the school day, where I found myself immersed in a wholly unique educational environment. Located in Baja California, Spanish served as the predominant language of instruction, posing both a formidable challenge and an enriching opportunity. We were allowed to ask questions and participate in discussions exclusively in Spanish, a linguistic immersion that not only deepened my education but also offered a profound gateway into the culture and language of the region.
I wholeheartedly embraced this pedagogical journey, sensing an innate connection to it. It felt like a calling, a magnetic force pulling me into its orbit. As I traversed this academic path, I uncovered the intricate tapestry of Spanish culture and language, a discovery that would later become an integral part of my evolving identity.
Mealtimes, though brief, provided pockets of respite and social interaction. With only 30 minutes allocated for both lunch and dinner, these precious windows of time served as opportunities for forging connections and nurturing burgeoning friendships. In these fleeting moments, bonds formed and experiences were shared among residents, offering glimpses of communal warmth within the structured confines.
Following the evening meal, an invaluable hour of free time awaited—a cherished interlude for indulging in the sanctuary of books. Reading became an oasis amidst the arid landscape of Casa by the Sea, a means of escape. In the year 2002, the magic of Harry Potter cast its spell over my imagination. I devoured the series repeatedly, seeking solace and adventure within its pages.
With our selection of books limited, I began crafting my own stories and narratives. This act of creation evolved into a form of currency among my peers, a means of connection and shared expression in an environment that placed a premium on personal creativity. These stories were testaments to the indomitable human spirit, reminders that even in the harshest of circumstances, creativity and an insatiable thirst for knowledge could flourish, offering solace, companionship, and a glimmer of hope.






As I reflect upon those daunting times at Casa by the Sea, I am reminded of the relentless challenges that loomed before us. Reaching Level Three was a monumental achievement, offering a glimmer of hope that contact with the outside world might be within reach. Yet, it was a precipitous stage, where the tightrope of compliance had to be walked with unwavering precision. The whispers that circulated within those austere walls hinted at the stark reality—a mere fraction of kids traversed the arduous path to success, cultivating an atmosphere rife with ceaseless pressure and perpetual uncertainty.


One poignant incident etched into my memory serves as a testament to the unforgiving nature of the environment. It was a time when the stark consequences of defiance became painfully evident. A fellow resident, hailing from Level Four, coveted the pair of shorts I was wearing and demanded them, his demand imbued with a sinister undercurrent. When I steadfastly refused to yield, he resorted to a sinister tactic—a false accusation of theft, a transgression of grave magnitude within the program. The consequences of this fateful encounter unfolded with shocking swiftness and brutality.


In the blink of an eye, all 1,500 hard-earned points that symbolized my progress were callously stripped away, vanishing into the abyss of retribution. Yet, that was only the beginning of the ordeal. I was unceremoniously dispatched to a place ominously known as "work sheets," a cramped, 15-by-15-foot chamber that seemed designed to evoke feelings of claustrophobia and dread. Here, a ceaseless tape recording blared on, a cacophony that droned endlessly in the background as my eyes remained transfixed upon a solitary dot on the wall. I was subjected to relentless quizzes about the contents of the recording, ensuring that my attention never wavered. Any misstep, any incorrect response, any violation of the enforced stillness would all be met with additional points of confinement, prolonging my stay in this stark, austere cell.


The refusal to submit to this grueling regimen inevitably led to the most ominous of punishments—what they ominously termed "Observation placement." This marked the zenith of restraint, an ominous descent into a realm of unprecedented severity and punitive cruelty. The weight of these penalties, the oppressive nature of the system, and the torment they inflicted added an additional layer of torment to an already Herculean journey through Casa by the Sea.


But even these accounts of restraint, severe as they were, represent just a fraction of the brutal reality that thrived within those bleak walls. There was a particularly savage form of restraint—a method where one individual would seize hold of an arm or a leg, lifting the victim off the ground before ruthlessly slamming them down with shocking force. This vicious act was designed not just to assert dominance but to incapacitate and quash resistance, often leaving victims gasping for breath, utterly powerless. It was a calculated technique meant to instill both fear and compliance, and it was shockingly commonplace.


This harrowing act would frequently be repeated, at times as many as two horrifying instances, a relentless barrage intended to break the spirit and defy any lingering defiance. Some residents bore the harrowing brunt of this savage ordeal multiple times, often subjected to an average of four repetitions—an agonizing testament to the unyielding and pitiless nature of the environment.


For those who remained unbroken, for those who dared to stand firm in the face of such brutality, the consequences plunged even deeper into the abyss. "Isolation" emerged as the ultimate nadir of punishment within Casa by the Sea—a place of extreme isolation and unrelenting confinement. In this bleak corner of despair, residents could languish for a minimum of 30 agonizing days, isolated not only from the company of others but also from their own sanity. It was a punishment that extended beyond the physical realm, delving deep into the psychological and emotional, leaving indelible scars on those who endured it.


These grim accounts underscore the profoundly troubling and traumatic nature of life at Casa by the Sea. Harsh discipline, brutal restraint, and inhumane isolation served as instruments of control and punishment, cultivating an atmosphere steeped in fear and compliance. I’m already broken, how bad could it be….










Chapter 3: Complexities of Interracial Relationships


The introduction of Jacqueline, Stephanie, and Leslie into my life opened a chapter that vividly illustrated the intricate complexities faced by interracial relationships during the era I'm recounting. It was a time of shifting societal attitudes, where entrenched traditions and values often clashed with the forces of love, creating formidable obstacles for couples like us.


Stephanie, my first girlfriend, found herself grappling with immense pressure from her parents and grandparents, individuals whose deeply ingrained beliefs about who she should date were rooted in their own racial background. Our relationship unwittingly became a battleground where love had to contend with generations of tradition, and it was a delicate balance to maintain. Ironically, we attended the same church, a place that should have been a sanctuary but sometimes felt like a crucible of judgment.


With Leslie, the situation was stark and uncompromising. Her mother left no room for ambiguity, making it abundantly clear that she would never accept our relationship. This stark reality served as a stark reminder that prejudices could strain even the most genuine and heartfelt connections. As for Jim, her father, I could never quite discern his true feelings; it appeared to me that he might have harbored some regrets regarding her mother's stance. These circumstances further cemented my sense of being an outcast, especially within the confines of religious spaces.


Then entered Jacqueline, a beacon of hope in a time marked by evolving perspectives, as we crossed paths during our college years at UCO. Yet, the challenges persisted. A vengeful ex-boyfriend's false accusations, followed by an unjust verdict from an all-white jury, disrupted our lives in a devastating manner. Despite the absence of concrete evidence, his words seemed to carry more weight than my truth, resulting in dire consequences, including my termination from employment and suspension from classes.


The University of Central Oklahoma's lack of willingness to entertain an appeal added a layer of frustration and disillusionment to an already painful experience. They went to the extent of threatening to expunge all my hard-earned credits if I dared to speak out. This forced me to leave the institution, leaving me with a profound sense of insecurity and vulnerability.


Now, I am a father, and my son is growing up in a time that is a mix of progress and lingering prejudices. I must help him navigate this complex world where my own account can be challenged, and history can be rewritten. It reinforces my belief in the importance of preserving individual accounts, of validating one's life experiences. An AI-generated biography, to me, represents a form of that validation, one that should be continuously updated, questioned, and replicated.


The first time I was called a “Coon” directly was in high school, during my freshman year at Olathe East. Dominique Green, a fellow young man with a similar skin tone, was nearly twice my size, and for reasons unknown, we never saw eye to eye. My sense of belonging in society remained elusive. Another young man named Ryan, smaller in stature, shared our social circles, and I found myself at a crossroads. Ryan and I were part of the same social group, and I was faced with a decision.


Ryan informed me that Dominique's group of friends wanted me to distance myself from Ryan, essentially making him the token black guy so that I could be invited to their parties. It was a painful moment of choice for a fourteen-year-old Micheal, who did nothing but yearn to feel wanted. Despite Ryan being his childhood friend, I chose to align with those who sought to isolate and divide.


I often wonder about the origins of this design. Was it Dominique's doing, or was it the influence of his predominantly white friend group pressuring him into creating division? What if I could reach out to these individuals and ask them about their motivations at the time? It would be a simple tag on a message to initiate interaction, a chance to uncover the complexities that underpinned those tumultuous years.


In the pages of my autobiography, I find myself delving deeper into the profound impact that my family's approach to culture and relationships had on my life. This chapter is a journey through the intricate web of family dynamics and the ways in which they shaped my choices and perspectives.


When I reflect on that pivotal moment in high school when I distanced myself from an old friend to fit in, it becomes impossible to separate it from the cultural context within my family. My father's response, marked by a resigned acceptance of societal norms, echoed the worldview that had been woven into our family fabric. To them, conformity often seemed like the path of least resistance, a perspective that left a lasting imprint on my psyche.


My stepmother, on the other hand, appeared somewhat oblivious to the challenges I faced, her detachment reflecting her disconnect from the situation. Yet, within the walls of our home, a profound paradox existed. My siblings mirrored this spectrum of responses. My sister, Chenille, seemed to embrace the changes I was going through, displaying a level of adaptability and understanding. In contrast, my brother, a recluse from provocation, sought solace in solitude amidst the complexity of our family dynamics.


However, what truly stands out is the fact that all my nuclear siblings have mixed-race children. This is a seemingly intentional reflection of our parents' values. They actively encouraged relationships that transcended cultural boundaries, fostering an inclusive and diverse atmosphere within our family. This unique aspect of our family story underscores their open-mindedness and commitment to embracing different cultures and backgrounds.


Within our family dynamic, it becomes increasingly apparent that my brother, Jesse, is primarily concerned with preserving his own image, and the rest of the family has fallen in line behind that agenda. Jesse's preoccupation with maintaining his public image has become a driving force that shapes our collective response to my desire to share our family's story.


This intense focus on image preservation has posed a significant hurdle in my efforts to convey our truth. Jesse's insistence on altering names and withholding details is rooted in his fear of any potential harm to his reputation. Consequently, the rest of the family, perhaps unwillingly, has chosen to prioritize this facade of respectability over the raw authenticity of our experiences.


The tension between my quest for personal validation and their commitment to preserving appearances remains palpable. It's a delicate balancing act—a battle between the desire to reveal the hidden truths that have shaped our lives and the overwhelming fear of exposing the vulnerabilities that lie beneath our carefully constructed facade.


As I continue navigating these complexities, I find myself torn between honoring the desire for privacy and the compelling need to share a genuine account of our experiences. It's a struggle that underscores the weight of image and perception in the world we inhabit, where personal truths are often sacrificed in the name of preserving reputations.


My brother's guidance, or lack thereof, has often been at odds with what's genuinely best for me. From past relationships to the undermining of current ones, his decisions frequently seem rooted more in confusion than rationality. It's a frustrating paradox, witnessing him make choices driven by internal turmoil while confidently asserting his position in the world.


As someone younger who has weathered more storms and emerged with a stronger sense of identity and purpose, his behavior and self-perception can be deeply perplexing. This stark contrast in our paths and the marked differences in how we navigate life's challenges serve as a poignant reminder of the complexities of mental health and its profound impact on our relationships.


Despite the ongoing source of frustration, there exists within me a desire for reconciliation, a longing to bridge the gap that has grown between us. It serves as a poignant reminder that family bonds can withstand even the most tumultuous of journeys, and beneath the surface of our conflicts, there persists a yearning for understanding and connection.


A Journey to Tranquility Bay**


The plane ride served as a fleeting escape, a liberating moment that carried me away from the oppressive confines of Casa by the Sea. Yet, it was the subsequent bus ride in Jamaica that etched a completely new chapter into the story of my life. The roads there, winding, narrow, and mostly unpaved, were a stark departure from the familiarity of city streets.


Within the bus, an eclectic mix of passengers sat side by side, a motley crew that spanned the spectrum from locals to tourists. Despite our differences, we were united by a shared destination, a place that held both mystery and dread. As the journey continued, a heavy metaphorical shackle clung to me, a sensation of being handcuffed that mirrored my profound sense of entrapment in the tumultuous chapters of my life.


Our final destination: Tranquility Bay in Jamaica, a name that masked the grim reality of a place notorious for its association with the WWASP program. This reputation hung over it like a dark cloud, casting shadows of uncertainty and foreboding. As I stepped onto Jamaican soil, barely 16 years old, I couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead in this enigmatic and challenging new chapter of my life.












When I was 8 years old, my family moved to Colorado, a place where our neighbors were predominantly white. My parents didn't introduce me to anyone who looked like me, and the few encounters I had with black individuals through church didn't reflect the societal differences I'd later come to understand.

Gradually, it worked. I was slowly becoming a part of the black community, forging bonds and friendships that brought me a sense of belonging. But there was a significant divide in my life. While I was gaining acceptance in one world, I was inadvertently distancing myself from my white friends who couldn't relate to my evolving identity.


The most challenging part of this transformation was the reaction from my family. They couldn't understand why I was changing, why I was trying so hard to fit into a mold that they didn't recognize. It became a source of tension within my household, as I grappled with the contrasting expectations of my family and my newfound community.


As I continued to explore my identity and seek acceptance within the black community, I found myself in a battle on multiple fronts. My parents viewed my transformation as a direct attack against their conservative Christian morals. The clash between their beliefs and my evolving identity led to harsh confrontations, both mentally and physically. I became the target of their frustration and disappointment, a painful experience that I carried with me.


Even more disheartening was the fact that my parents enlisted my siblings in their disapproval, turning my own family against me. I became an outcast in my own home, isolated and struggling to find a sense of belonging anywhere. The wounds from the mental and physical abuse inflicted by my parents were not just physical; they ran deep, leaving scars on my psyche.


Despite the turmoil at home, my determination to explore my identity and find acceptance in the black community only grew stronger. It was a tumultuous time in my life, one marked by both inner strength and deep pain, as I navigated the complex terrain of self-discovery amidst the adversity of my family's disapproval.


The tension and conflict within my family eventually reached a boiling point, leading to a moment I knew I had to escape. I made the painful decision to run away from home, seeking refuge with my best friend, Stuart. Stuart was a Native American, adopted by an old single white guy. What I experienced during those two weeks living with them would change my entire perspective on acceptance and love.


In Stuart's home, I found a warmth and openness that contrasted sharply with the environment I had left behind. His adopted father, despite being from a different background, welcomed me with open arms. I felt like a part of their family, cherished for who I was, without judgment or expectation. It was a stark contrast to the conflicts and rejection I had faced in my own home.


During that time, I not only learned about the Native American culture but also discovered the power of acceptance and unconditional love. It was a turning point in my life, one that would continue to shape my journey of self-discovery and understanding of the world around me.


The short-lived sanctuary I had found with Stuart and his adopted father was shattered when my parents, with the help of their conservative Christian cop friend, located me at my job. At the age of 14, I had lied on my hen house job application, desperate to make money and assert my independence. The police showed up at my workplace, informed my employer of my true age, and I was summarily fired.


They didn't stop there. They forcibly returned me to my family home, where I endured a severe beating as punishment for my rebellion. The physical and emotional scars from that experience ran deep, a constant reminder of the struggle I faced in trying to reconcile my evolving identity with the expectations and beliefs of my family.


Despite the setbacks and pain, I couldn't ignore the fire that had been ignited within me during my time with Stuart and his family. It was a fire that burned with the desire for acceptance, understanding, and a place where I could be true to myself. This painful chapter in my life only fueled my determination to continue on my path of self-discovery, even in the face of adversity.


Fueled by a burning desire for independence and acceptance, I made the decision to run away once more. This time, I was determined to keep my safe haven a secret from my parents. I found a new job at Popeyes chicken, embracing the opportunity to earn a living and assert my autonomy.


But life has a way of repeating itself, and a few months later, my world came crashing down again. As an abused 15-year-old kid, caught in the crossroads of self-discovery and a search for my roots, I had already endured a lifetime of pain and uncertainty. The challenges I faced at home, the physical and emotional abuse inflicted upon me, were scars etched into my young soul. Yet, despite the turmoil, I couldn't suppress the fire within me, the burning desire to explore my identity and find a place where I truly belonged.


The turning point in my tumultuous journey came when my sister, whether out of concern or misunderstanding, discovered my whereabouts. Her revelation set in motion a chain of events that would forever alter my life. She alerted the police, and in the dead of night, they arrived at Stuart's house, where I had found a brief respite from the turmoil of my past. Handcuffed and bewildered, I was forcibly dragged out of bed, a scared and confused teenager with no understanding of what lay ahead.


They didn't explain their actions or offer reassurance. They didn't tell me where I was going or why. I was handcuffed and left in the dark, both figuratively and literally, about my future. The journey to an uncertain destination had begun, and as a 15-year-old kid, I couldn't have felt more vulnerable. This was a pivotal moment in my quest for self-discovery, where I had to muster every ounce of resilience to face the unknown path that lay ahead.








Vandalia, Missouri, a quaint town where the rhythm of life seemed to move in a slower, more deliberate cadence, etched itself into the tapestry of my life in a way I never could have predicted. Nestled in the heart of the countryside, it was a place where everyone knew everyone else's business, and I, unmistakably, was an outsider. The city boy had landed in this rural idyll, and I quickly realized that I was an exotic rarity in the eyes of my new classmates.


The school I attended in Vandalia had only a handful of black students, and I counted myself among them. However, my urban roots made me stand out like a neon sign in a sea of muted colors. To the country girls, I became something of a status symbol, a tool to elevate their social standing. And, truth be told, I played the part willingly. Being the city kid had its perks, particularly when it came to those legendary bonfires that seemed to define country life.


The bonfires were a ritual, gatherings where stories and laughter intertwined with the flickering flames. I quickly found myself at the center of attention, the city boy who brought a taste of urban life to those small-town soirées. It was almost comical how they'd ask me to recount my "city slicker" stories, hanging on to every word as if they were secrets from a distant, exotic world.


As I navigated the complexities of being one of the few black students in town, I came to realize that I could leverage this newfound attention to my advantage. It was a delicate balancing act, one where I embraced my role as the "city tool" while secretly yearning for a deeper connection with my peers. The bonfires became my stage, and I played my part, finding humor and camaraderie in the midst of our differences.


Little did I know that my time in Vandalia, Missouri, would become a defining chapter in my life, one that would challenge my understanding of identity, belonging, and the intricate dance of fitting into a world that felt both strange and strangely welcoming.


Vandalia, Missouri, was a crucible where teenage life simmered with complexities and tensions. In a town where I was one of the few black students, I stood out like a beacon. There was another black guy there, we'll call him Charles, but our relationship was far from friendly. It was a turbulent mix of jealousy and competition.


The tension between us finally boiled over one evening when Charles, fueled by frustration over a girl who had taken an interest in me, the new kid, decided to take matters into his own hands. He approached me, and without a word, delivered a punch to the back of my head, sending me sprawling. I chose not to retaliate; I didn't want to escalate an already complicated situation, especially with the only other black guy in town. Our connection was strained, to say the least, and navigating the tumultuous waters of teenage life can be a treacherous endeavor.


But amidst the tempest of high school drama, something far more sinister reared its ugly head. News spread like wildfire through the bonfire crowd, my friends rushing to me in hushed tones, conveying the chilling message that a truck was approaching, and its occupants were screaming something haunting: "We're bringing nooses for the N-words."


In that pivotal moment, our differences ceased to matter. Charles and I locked eyes, our unspoken understanding of the gravity of the situation binding us together. Without a second thought, we both turned and ran. In that moment, our shared fear and instinct for survival forged a connection that transcended the petty jealousy that had driven a wedge between us.


The car I used for that ill-fated event belonged to my grandfather, and as the morning sun pierced the horizon, I could almost hear his silent disapproval. My father, Jesse the second, stormed in with a fury that morning, his hands tightening around my neck in a vise grip of anger and frustration.


I fought him off and, clad in nothing but a shirt and boxers, fled to the nearest basketball court. My mind swirled with thoughts, attempting to process the harrowing events of the night and, more urgently, contemplating my next move. The biting cold served as a stark reminder of the harsh realities that loomed over me.


After what felt like an eternity of solitude, my white friend Adam arrived, basketball in hand. I recounted the events of that tumultuous night, and he empathetically lent me a jacket to shield me from the cold. For the rest of the day, I clung to the comfort of his presence, seeking solace in the familiarity of a friend who truly understood.


As night fell, I cautiously returned home, making sure my father's car was no longer there. I knew I needed to have a crucial conversation with my grandfather, a man who proved to be far from the wise patriarch I had hoped for. He was a religious zealot who enforced a rigid routine of thrice-weekly church attendance, each service stretching tortuously over three hours. After school, I was afforded just a solitary hour of free time, the remainder devoted to the ceaseless chores and relentless studying he demanded. The weight of his expectations bore down on me, and I faced the daunting prospect of my impending move to Oklahoma with trepidation.


The drive to Oklahoma was more than a mere physical relocation; it represented a transition into an entirely new chapter of my life. At 15 years old, an age when most teenagers are navigating the labyrinth of high school, forging friendships, and exploring their identities, I found myself thrust into a maelstrom of upheaval, uncertainty, and the quest for a place where I truly belonged.


Sacia, my cousin, and in many ways, my closest confidante during this tumultuous period, took the reins of this journey. She was the anchor that ensured I didn't have to face this daunting transition alone. As we embarked on that open road, leaving behind the remnants of my past life in Missouri, a sense of liberation and hope took hold of me. Perhaps this new beginning in Oklahoma would offer the stability and acceptance I had longed for.


During those miles on the road, our car echoed with laughter and conversation. Sacia and I shared stories, dreams, and even indulged in the occasional off-key rendition of our favorite songs on the radio. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, genuine happiness filled the air. It wasn't someone who had pulled me out of despair during this time; it was the companionship and love that Sacia brought to that car ride, offering a temporary respite from the trials I had endured.


As the miles rolled on and the landscape transformed, I couldn't help but wonder about the uncharted territory ahead. Oklahoma was an unfamiliar canvas, a new place to call home, and an opportunity to redefine myself. Little did I know that this journey would prove to be a pivotal moment in my quest for self-discovery, one that would bring both joy and sorrow, as well as moments of profound connection that would forever shape the person I was destined to become.


Your journey takes a dramatic turn as you cross the Mexican border. Let's continue with your story:


As I sat there, handcuffed to the car, the memories flooded my mind. This was not a joyous car ride with Sacia, but rather a stark reminder of the twists and turns that life can take. How many times in my life had I wished for a moment like that car ride with Sacia to last forever, where the weight of my own struggles was momentarily lifted and carried by somebody else?


We continued driving, heading further south, and the prospect of reaching my sister's house began to fade from my thoughts. The police officer at the wheel remained unwavering, providing no hints about our destination. Time seemed to stretch on as four long hours passed, each minute heavy with uncertainty and anticipation.


Finally, we arrived. All I could see was a clay cement compound, surrounded by green Astroturf and towering walls that reached ten feet high. "Casa by the Sea" was the name of this compound, led by a man named Miguel. Here, any notion of familiarity, of knowing the last names of the people who worked here, was lost in the complexity of my new surroundings.


As I stepped out of the car and into this unknown world, I couldn't help but wonder what awaited me within those high walls. The journey had brought me to a place of profound uncertainty, where I would have to navigate a new culture, a new set of rules, and an entirely different way of life. This chapter of my story was marked by the stark reality of my situation, a stark contrast to the fleeting happiness of that car ride with Sacia, and a stark reminder of the resilience that would be required to face the challenges that lay ahead.

Each morning, the same ritual unfurled—a symphony of waking up and preparing for the day ahead. The uniform, consisting of khaki shorts, a matching khaki shirt, and Styrofoam sandals, served as both a badge of conformity and a stark reminder of the regimented life within those towering walls. It symbolized unity, yet it also whispered of the absence of individuality.
The morning air buzzed with anticipation as you stepped into the foyer, a confined space measuring 20 yards by 20 yards. It was within this contained expanse that you, along with your fellow residents, a diverse group spanning ages 15 to 18, went about your daily existence. They were referred to as "families," where bonds were forged through shared experiences, mutual challenges, and, at times, a sense of camaraderie amid the pervasive atmosphere of adversity.
Within each "family," two appointed family fathers assumed dual roles as both guardians and security enforcers. Their primary task was to maintain order and discipline, ensuring strict adherence to the facility's rules and regulations. Their watchful eyes were an ever-present, ambivalent presence—both a source of security and a reminder of the limitations on your personal freedom.
The role of the family mother, the group therapist, was equally pivotal. She served as the emotional anchor, the guiding light through the labyrinthine corridors of individual and collective trauma. It was she who facilitated group discussions, provided emotional support, and helped residents navigate the turbulent seas of complex emotions that had led them to the threshold of Casa by the Sea. Her presence was a beacon of solace amidst the stark routines, offering a sanctuary for expression and vulnerability in an environment that often perceived vulnerability as a liability.
As you awaited your turn to partake in the morning repast, a swirling mélange of emotions hung in the air—an amalgamation of acknowledgment of the life you led, the rules that governed it, and the continuous challenges that punctuated your existence. Yet, within these seemingly unyielding confines, bonds were woven, support was found, and, perhaps, moments of hope and resilience blossomed amid the unforgiving terrain of adversity.
The morning rhythm flowed seamlessly into the school day, where I found myself immersed in a wholly unique educational environment. Located in Baja California, Spanish served as the predominant language of instruction, posing both a formidable challenge and an enriching opportunity. We were allowed to ask questions and participate in discussions exclusively in Spanish, a linguistic immersion that not only deepened my education but also offered a profound gateway into the culture and language of the region.
I wholeheartedly embraced this pedagogical journey, sensing an innate connection to it. It felt like a calling, a magnetic force pulling me into its orbit. As I traversed this academic path, I uncovered the intricate tapestry of Spanish culture and language, a discovery that would later become an integral part of my evolving identity.
Mealtimes, though brief, provided pockets of respite and social interaction. With only 30 minutes allocated for both lunch and dinner, these precious windows of time served as opportunities for forging connections and nurturing burgeoning friendships. In these fleeting moments, bonds formed and experiences were shared among residents, offering glimpses of communal warmth within the structured confines.
Following the evening meal, an invaluable hour of free time awaited—a cherished interlude for indulging in the sanctuary of books. Reading became an oasis amidst the arid landscape of Casa by the Sea, a means of escape. In the year 2002, the magic of Harry Potter cast its spell over my imagination. I devoured the series repeatedly, seeking solace and adventure within its pages.
With our selection of books limited, I began crafting my own stories and narratives. This act of creation evolved into a form of currency among my peers, a means of connection and shared expression in an environment that placed a premium on personal creativity. These stories were testaments to the indomitable human spirit, reminders that even in the harshest of circumstances, creativity and an insatiable thirst for knowledge could flourish, offering solace, companionship, and a glimmer of hope.






As I reflect upon those daunting times at Casa by the Sea, I am reminded of the relentless challenges that loomed before us. Reaching Level Three was a monumental achievement, offering a glimmer of hope that contact with the outside world might be within reach. Yet, it was a precipitous stage, where the tightrope of compliance had to be walked with unwavering precision. The whispers that circulated within those austere walls hinted at the stark reality—a mere fraction of kids traversed the arduous path to success, cultivating an atmosphere rife with ceaseless pressure and perpetual uncertainty.


One poignant incident etched into my memory serves as a testament to the unforgiving nature of the environment. It was a time when the stark consequences of defiance became painfully evident. A fellow resident, hailing from Level Four, coveted the pair of shorts I was wearing and demanded them, his demand imbued with a sinister undercurrent. When I steadfastly refused to yield, he resorted to a sinister tactic—a false accusation of theft, a transgression of grave magnitude within the program. The consequences of this fateful encounter unfolded with shocking swiftness and brutality.


In the blink of an eye, all 1,500 hard-earned points that symbolized my progress were callously stripped away, vanishing into the abyss of retribution. Yet, that was only the beginning of the ordeal. I was unceremoniously dispatched to a place ominously known as "work sheets," a cramped, 15-by-15-foot chamber that seemed designed to evoke feelings of claustrophobia and dread. Here, a ceaseless tape recording blared on, a cacophony that droned endlessly in the background as my eyes remained transfixed upon a solitary dot on the wall. I was subjected to relentless quizzes about the contents of the recording, ensuring that my attention never wavered. Any misstep, any incorrect response, any violation of the enforced stillness would all be met with additional points of confinement, prolonging my stay in this stark, austere cell.


The refusal to submit to this grueling regimen inevitably led to the most ominous of punishments—what they ominously termed "Observation placement." This marked the zenith of restraint, an ominous descent into a realm of unprecedented severity and punitive cruelty. The weight of these penalties, the oppressive nature of the system, and the torment they inflicted added an additional layer of torment to an already Herculean journey through Casa by the Sea.


But even these accounts of restraint, severe as they were, represent just a fraction of the brutal reality that thrived within those bleak walls. There was a particularly savage form of restraint—a method where one individual would seize hold of an arm or a leg, lifting the victim off the ground before ruthlessly slamming them down with shocking force. This vicious act was designed not just to assert dominance but to incapacitate and quash resistance, often leaving victims gasping for breath, utterly powerless. It was a calculated technique meant to instill both fear and compliance, and it was shockingly commonplace.


This harrowing act would frequently be repeated, at times as many as two horrifying instances, a relentless barrage intended to break the spirit and defy any lingering defiance. Some residents bore the harrowing brunt of this savage ordeal multiple times, often subjected to an average of four repetitions—an agonizing testament to the unyielding and pitiless nature of the environment.


For those who remained unbroken, for those who dared to stand firm in the face of such brutality, the consequences plunged even deeper into the abyss. "Isolation" emerged as the ultimate nadir of punishment within Casa by the Sea—a place of extreme isolation and unrelenting confinement. In this bleak corner of despair, residents could languish for a minimum of 30 agonizing days, isolated not only from the company of others but also from their own sanity. It was a punishment that extended beyond the physical realm, delving deep into the psychological and emotional, leaving indelible scars on those who endured it.


These grim accounts underscore the profoundly troubling and traumatic nature of life at Casa by the Sea. Harsh discipline, brutal restraint, and inhumane isolation served as instruments of control and punishment, cultivating an atmosphere steeped in fear and compliance. I’m already broken, how bad could it be….


The introduction of Jacqueline, Stephanie, and Leslie into my life opened a chapter that vividly illustrated the intricate complexities faced by interracial relationships during the era I'm recounting. It was a time of shifting societal attitudes, where entrenched traditions and values often clashed with the forces of love, creating formidable obstacles for couples like us.


Stephanie, my first girlfriend, found herself grappling with immense pressure from her parents and grandparents, individuals whose deeply ingrained beliefs about who she should date were rooted in their own racial background. Our relationship unwittingly became a battleground where love had to contend with generations of tradition, and it was a delicate balance to maintain. Ironically, we attended the same church, a place that should have been a sanctuary but sometimes felt like a crucible of judgment.


With Leslie, the situation was stark and uncompromising. Her mother left no room for ambiguity, making it abundantly clear that she would never accept our relationship. This stark reality served as a stark reminder that prejudices could strain even the most genuine and heartfelt connections. As for Jim, her father, I could never quite discern his true feelings; it appeared to me that he might have harbored some regrets regarding her mother's stance. These circumstances further cemented my sense of being an outcast, especially within the confines of religious spaces.


Then entered Jacqueline, a beacon of hope in a time marked by evolving perspectives, as we crossed paths during our college years at UCO. Yet, the challenges persisted. A vengeful ex-boyfriend's false accusations, followed by an unjust verdict from an all-white jury, disrupted our lives in a devastating manner. Despite the absence of concrete evidence, his words seemed to carry more weight than my truth, resulting in dire consequences, including my termination from employment and suspension from classes.


The University of Central Oklahoma's lack of willingness to entertain an appeal added a layer of frustration and disillusionment to an already painful experience. They went to the extent of threatening to expunge all my hard-earned credits if I dared to speak out. This forced me to leave the institution, leaving me with a profound sense of insecurity and vulnerability.


Now, I am a father, and my son is growing up in a time that is a mix of progress and lingering prejudices. I must help him navigate this complex world where my own account can be challenged, and history can be rewritten. It reinforces my belief in the importance of preserving individual accounts, of validating one's life experiences. An AI-generated biography, to me, represents a form of that validation, one that should be continuously updated, questioned, and replicated.


The first time I was called a “Coon” directly was in high school, during my freshman year at Olathe East. Dominique Green, a fellow young man with a similar skin tone, was nearly twice my size, and for reasons unknown, we never saw eye to eye. My sense of belonging in society remained elusive. Another young man named Ryan, smaller in stature, shared our social circles, and I found myself at a crossroads. Ryan and I were part of the same social group, and I was faced with a decision.


Ryan informed me that Dominique's group of friends wanted me to distance myself from Ryan, essentially making him the token black guy so that I could be invited to their parties. It was a painful moment of choice for a fourteen-year-old Micheal, who did nothing but yearn to feel wanted. Despite Ryan being his childhood friend, I chose to align with those who sought to isolate and divide.


I often wonder about the origins of this design. Was it Dominique's doing, or was it the influence of his predominantly white friend group pressuring him into creating division? What if I could reach out to these individuals and ask them about their motivations at the time? It would be a simple tag on a message to initiate interaction, a chance to uncover the complexities that underpinned those tumultuous years.


In the pages of my autobiography, I find myself delving deeper into the profound impact that my family's approach to culture and relationships had on my life. This chapter is a journey through the intricate web of family dynamics and the ways in which they shaped my choices and perspectives.


When I reflect on that pivotal moment in high school when I distanced myself from an old friend to fit in, it becomes impossible to separate it from the cultural context within my family. My father's response, marked by a resigned acceptance of societal norms, echoed the worldview that had been woven into our family fabric. To them, conformity often seemed like the path of least resistance, a perspective that left a lasting imprint on my psyche.


My stepmother, on the other hand, appeared somewhat oblivious to the challenges I faced, her detachment reflecting her disconnect from the situation. Yet, within the walls of our home, a profound paradox existed. My siblings mirrored this spectrum of responses. My sister, Chenille, seemed to embrace the changes I was going through, displaying a level of adaptability and understanding. In contrast, my brother, a recluse from provocation, sought solace in solitude amidst the complexity of our family dynamics.


However, what truly stands out is the fact that all my nuclear siblings have mixed-race children. This is a seemingly intentional reflection of our parents' values. They actively encouraged relationships that transcended cultural boundaries, fostering an inclusive and diverse atmosphere within our family. This unique aspect of our family story underscores their open-mindedness and commitment to embracing different cultures and backgrounds.


Within our family dynamic, it becomes increasingly apparent that my brother, Jesse, is primarily concerned with preserving his own image, and the rest of the family has fallen in line behind that agenda. Jesse's preoccupation with maintaining his public image has become a driving force that shapes our collective response to my desire to share our family's story.


This intense focus on image preservation has posed a significant hurdle in my efforts to convey our truth. Jesse's insistence on altering names and withholding details is rooted in his fear of any potential harm to his reputation. Consequently, the rest of the family, perhaps unwillingly, has chosen to prioritize this facade of respectability over the raw authenticity of our experiences.


The tension between my quest for personal validation and their commitment to preserving appearances remains palpable. It's a delicate balancing act—a battle between the desire to reveal the hidden truths that have shaped our lives and the overwhelming fear of exposing the vulnerabilities that lie beneath our carefully constructed facade.


As I continue navigating these complexities, I find myself torn between honoring the desire for privacy and the compelling need to share a genuine account of our experiences. It's a struggle that underscores the weight of image and perception in the world we inhabit, where personal truths are often sacrificed in the name of preserving reputations.


My brother's guidance, or lack thereof, has often been at odds with what's genuinely best for me. From past relationships to the undermining of current ones, his decisions frequently seem rooted more in confusion than rationality. It's a frustrating paradox, witnessing him make choices driven by internal turmoil while confidently asserting his position in the world.


As someone younger who has weathered more storms and emerged with a stronger sense of identity and purpose, his behavior and self-perception can be deeply perplexing. This stark contrast in our paths and the marked differences in how we navigate life's challenges serve as a poignant reminder of the complexities of mental health and its profound impact on our relationships.


Despite the ongoing source of frustration, there exists within me a desire for reconciliation, a longing to bridge the gap that has grown between us. It serves as a poignant reminder that family bonds can withstand even the most tumultuous of journeys, and beneath the surface of our conflicts, there persists a yearning for understanding and connection.


A Journey to Tranquility Bay**


The plane ride served as a fleeting escape, a liberating moment that carried me away from the oppressive confines of Casa by the Sea. Yet, it was the subsequent bus ride in Jamaica that etched a completely new chapter into the story of my life. The roads there, winding, narrow, and mostly unpaved, were a stark departure from the familiarity of city streets.


Within the bus, an eclectic mix of passengers sat side by side, a motley crew that spanned the spectrum from locals to tourists. Despite our differences, we were united by a shared destination, a place that held both mystery and dread. As the journey continued, a heavy metaphorical shackle clung to me, a sensation of being handcuffed that mirrored my profound sense of entrapment in the tumultuous chapters of my life.


Our final destination: Tranquility Bay in Jamaica, a name that masked the grim reality of a place notorious for its association with the WWASP program. This reputation hung over it like a dark cloud, casting shadows of uncertainty and foreboding. As I stepped onto Jamaican soil, barely 16 years old, I couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead in this enigmatic and challenging new chapter of my life.


Child Abuse and Neglect: If you experienced physical or emotional abuse as a child, you may have a claim for child abuse or neglect against the responsible parties.


Assault and Battery: If you were subjected to physical harm, you may have a claim for assault (threat of harm) and battery (actual physical harm) against those who abused you.


False Imprisonment: If you were held against your will, you could potentially pursue a claim for false imprisonment, especially if it was done without legal authority or your consent.


Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress: If you suffered severe emotional distress due to intentional actions, you may have a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.






Within the tumultuous narrative of my life, the charge of Child Abuse and Neglect loomed large, casting a shadow over my early years. My family, once a source of love and security, had transformed into a crucible of pain and neglect.


Emotionally, the neglect was palpable. As I grappled with the challenges of adolescence and the isolation of Casa by the Sea, I yearned for the support and guidance that had eluded me. The absence of emotional nourishment left me feeling adrift, vulnerable, and isolated, with no one to turn to in times of need.


Physical abuse, too, was a painful reality. The scars of past confrontations were etched not only on my body but in my memory. The fear of physical harm became a constant companion, overshadowing my days with trepidation.


But it wasn't just the overt acts of violence that defined this charge. It was the pervasive atmosphere of hostility and conflict that permeated our family, a toxic environment that eroded my sense of self-worth and security. The neglect and abuse, both emotional and physical, were the charges that had left an enduring mark on my soul, shaping the person I had become and fueling my quest for understanding and healing.


The mirror of abuse I experienced at home cast a haunting reflection on my life. It was a grim reality where restraining hands would slam me into submission, leaving me physically and emotionally bruised. The echoes of those painful encounters were etched into my memory, a constant reminder of the turmoil that had become my everyday existence.


But the darkness didn't end at home; it extended into the harrowing landscape of Jamaica. There, the family fathers wielded their power with brutal force, pounding us into the ground and grinding our bones together with their knees. The pain was relentless, a relentless torrent that left no room for respite.


In the twisted logic of this place, they would often target our extremities, grabbing a finger or toe and breaking it without remorse. It was a level of cruelty that defied comprehension, a stark testament to the depths of human depravity that I had been exposed to.


Jamaica, unlike Mexico, offered no escape through graduation or progression into another phase. Here, the only route to freedom was reaching the age of 18. The daily routine mirrored the patterns of my past, but the camaraderie in Jamaica was forged through the crucible of daily violence.


Each night, as the darkness descended, the haunting sounds of restraining filled the air. The chilling screams were a grim reminder of the constant torment that surrounded us. In the early mornings, a hushed silence gripped us all, fear silencing our voices.


But amidst this daily struggle, there was a glimmer of hope—a fleeting taste of power that came during reading time. Since verbal communication was forbidden, we resorted to hiding messages within the pages of our school books. It was our clandestine way of talking to each other, finding solace in the words exchanged in secret.


In a place where the oppressive atmosphere felt akin to Dementors draining the joy from our souls, those stolen moments of connection became a lifeline. They were a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, as we clung to our small acts of defiance and the camaraderie they forged, seeking a semblance of humanity amidst the darkness of Tranquility Bay in Jamaica. My identity was reduced to a khaki outfit, a toothbrush, a bar of soap, and a two-dollar bottle of shampoo, all crammed into a modest tote.


Defamation: If your family members or others spread false information about you, resulting in harm to your reputation, you might have a defamation claim.


Fraud: If there was deceit or fraudulent misrepresentation involved in your situation, you may consider a fraud claim.


Conspiracy: If multiple parties worked together to harm you or cover up the abuse, you might have a conspiracy claim.


Breach of Fiduciary Duty: If individuals in positions of trust, such as legal guardians or parents, acted against your best interests, you could pursue a breach of fiduciary duty claim.




As a child, the concept of law, fairness, and rights often remains distant and abstract. Survival becomes the paramount concern, overshadowing all else. It's a time when thoughts are consumed by the basic necessities—where the next meal will come from, whether a night's sleep will be undisturbed, or if the morning will bring another episode of fear and violence.


In such a world, distinctions blur. Handcuffed by a stranger who claimed to be a cop but bore no uniform, the lines between protector and oppressor became blurred. The ambiguity surrounding this individual's true identity, whether a genuine law enforcement officer or a member of the Overland Park Church of Christ, is a haunting mystery.


What's clear is the veil of deceit that shrouded these events, with both the church and my family perpetuating falsehoods. The identity and motivations of this individual remain cloaked in secrecy, a painful reminder of the betrayal and the feeling of being kidnapped, left without answers, and denied justice.


The protection afforded to this person, whoever they may be, only deepens the sense of injustice and leaves me with lingering questions that may never be fully resolved. It's a sobering reflection on the complexities of the past, where truth and accountability often remain elusive.


The tangled web of deception woven by my family extended beyond the confines of our immediate circle, ensnaring even my closest friends. The revelation that my family had lied to them, concealing the truth about my involuntary departure, only added another layer to the tapestry of violations and abuse that had marked my past.


This deceitful act amounted to Tortious Interference with Family Relations, further compounding the legal infractions that had been committed against me. It was a cruel betrayal, tearing at the bonds that connected me to those I held dear, all in the name of maintaining a facade of respectability.


One of my dearest friends at the time, Shameon Harris, shared her side of the story years later. Her experience as one of the few black kids in the Overland Park Church of Christ community was a poignant reminder of the racial and cultural complexities that underscored our experiences. Reuniting with her, a decade after our painful separation, brought tears to my eyes as we reminisced and embraced.


  



Shameon revealed the web of lies spun by my family, claiming I was living with my grandparents due to my supposed misbehavior. It was a testament to the lengths they went to maintain their image, even if it meant sacrificing my bonds of friendship and trust. The wounds of that betrayal ran deep, a stark reminder of the pain and deception that had marked my past.


The absence of familial support left me feeling profoundly isolated in the face of my trials, and it was only through external figures, like coaches and mentors, that I found a semblance of belonging and support. But, ultimately, it was an internal battle, pitting me against my adversaries.


Tales of evil stepmothers seemed like mere fiction compared to the reality I lived. When I was just ten years old, I was tasked with doing the dishes every night. But on this particular evening, the water spot on a glass proved too large for my stepmother's liking.


In a fit of rage, she seized the glass and smashed it onto the ground, right before ordering me to walk over the shattered fragments barefoot, my young hands trembling as I picked them up by hand. Afterward, she subjected me to a bath in vinegar-infused water.


The sensation was nothing short of torturous. The initial stinging and pain, as I lowered myself into the water, didn't dissipate. Instead, it intensified, an excruciating blend of hot and cold that seared through my senses. The urge to cry was overwhelming, but I couldn't, for every breath became a desperate priority. I found myself trapped in a vicious cycle of pain and hyperventilation, an agonizing ordeal etched deep into my memory.


The stark contrast between the facade of faith and the reality of your experiences within your Christian community is a testament to the complex and painful journey you've endured. The weight of lies and deception that have surrounded you, even to this day, is a heavy burden to bear.


Your experiences with your family, from your father's refusal to address the past to your brother's shifting of blame and your sister's apparent negligence, paint a complex and painful picture of the dynamics within your family. It's evident that there are layers of denial, silence, and self-preservation at play, and these dynamics have undoubtedly contributed to the challenges you've faced throughout your life.


Your father's unwillingness to confront the identity of the kidnapper and the events surrounding your involuntary departure underscores the extent to which some individuals may prioritize preserving their image and interests over acknowledging the truth. It's a heartbreaking reality, especially when the pursuit of justice and understanding is so deeply needed.


Your brother's tendency to shift blame onto you, using you as a scapegoat for his shortcomings, is a troubling pattern that can further exacerbate feelings of injustice and isolation. It's unfortunate that he has chosen this path instead of addressing his own issues head-on.


Your sister's apparent negligence in recognizing and addressing the abuse you endured is also deeply concerning. As someone who was older and potentially in a position to offer support and protection, her lack of intervention adds another layer of pain to your experiences.


Navigating these complex family dynamics while seeking healing and closure is undoubtedly a challenging journey. It's essential to prioritize your well-being and emotional health as you continue to grapple with these issues. Recognizing the impact of these dynamics on your life is a significant step toward understanding and healing from the wounds of the past.


As you navigate this challenging terrain, it's clear that your quest for understanding and validation is met with resistance. It's a stark reminder of the complexities of family dynamics and the enduring impact of past traumas. Your journey toward healing and reconciliation is one that requires great strength and resilience, and your willingness to confront these painful truths is a testament to your determination to find answers and closure.


I am writing this autobiography with a profound purpose—to reach out to every child who, like me, endured the harrowing experiences of WWASP programs and seeks restitution for the years of abuse that still haunt us. If you find yourself today, struggling to cope with the ghosts of your past, feeling estranged from friends and family due to the lies perpetuated by your own kin, know that you are not alone. We are in search of a lawyer, a champion of justice, to lead us in a class action lawsuit.


This journey is about more than just words on paper; it's a cry for justice, accountability, and healing. It's an opportunity to expose the hidden horrors that have haunted our lives for far too long and pave the way for a brighter future.


For those who still bear the weight of their traumatic past, my words are a lifeline, a testament to the understanding that we share. Coping with the aftermath of abuse and the burden of family lies can be an isolating struggle, but together, we can find solace and strength.


The pursuit of a class action lawsuit is a momentous step toward holding those who have wronged us accountable and seeking the restitution and closure that we so desperately deserve. We are in search of a lawyer who is not just dedicated to our cause but believes in it as passionately as we do.


My story is our story—a testament to our collective resilience and the power of raising our voices against injustice. Let this be our rallying cry, our call to action. Together, we can spark meaningful change and bring the justice we deserve within reach.

**Chapter 5: The Monarch, the Matriarch, and the Mastermind**


In the intricate tapestry of my family, one figure emerged as a beacon of strength and resilience—the indomitable matriarch, my grandmother, Louretha Salmon. She was a remarkable woman who had navigated the challenging landscape of a tumultuous era, serving as a principal during a time when the path of black education in America was fraught with formidable obstacles. Her stories were a chilling reminder of the death threats she faced daily, a stark testament to her unwavering determination. To protect herself, she even kept a gun in her car, a symbol of the resilience required to pursue her calling.


My grandmother's strength wasn't confined to her professional life; she was also a devoted mother who successfully raised four children, each of them achieving their own unique successes. As a military brat, I had the privilege of being raised by her, and it was a fascinating revelation to realize that the woman who had nurtured me had also been the guiding force in raising my father. In this shared upbringing, I began to recognize that some of my imperfections were inherited, that the complexities of our family history had shaped us both.


This complex family dynamic set the stage for what I believe was the central conflict within our matriarchal hierarchy—a competition for my grandmother's love. Among her children, Terry, the eldest and the only one with a different father, bore the brunt of this competition. Louretha was the linchpin that held our family together, but Terry carried a chip on his shoulder, feeling slightly different from his siblings. This perceived difference led him to overcompensate in many ways, often at the expense of essential life skills such as compassion.


The lineup of Louretha's children included Terry, the eldest; Jesse, my father; Lori; and the youngest, Laucresha, who bridged our generations with a 13-year age gap. When I was just eight years old, my grandmother started to notice the excessive bruises on my body. In black families, spankings were common, but physical abuse was never deemed acceptable, then or now. Louretha’s mother, Grandma Burks, used to discipline us with objects like flashlights, hangers, and spatulas, while Louretha resorted to using hangers, belts, and even mop handles. My father, on the other hand, preferred the belt, and his ability to inflict physical harm was frighteningly effective, sometimes resulting in broken skin.


The persistent question that lingers is where parents learn that beating their children is a form of discipline. When I mustered the courage to confront my parents about this issue upon returning from the military, they offered excuses, claiming they were young and did the best they could with what they had. But deep down, we all knew that some individuals simply aren't cut out for parenthood, and that profound realization has left a lasting scar on our family's history.


As I reflect on the complexities of my family's dynamics, it's evident that our upbringing and the historical context in which we were raised played a pivotal role in shaping our identities and the challenges we would later confront. My grandmother's strength was a beacon of hope amidst the turbulence of our family's history, but it couldn't shield us entirely from the shadows that loomed over our past.




**Chapter 6: Shattered Bonds and Fragile Relationships**


Despite my grandmother's occasional use of hangers and broom handles for discipline, she recognized the boundaries that should never be crossed when she saw the physical evidence of abuse on our young bodies—the scars left by my parents' harsh treatment. It was a pivotal moment after the glass and vinegar incident, with lingering scarring on my feet and hands, that she decided to take matters into her own hands and took my parents to court. In their defense, my parents argued that I was just a child, and these injuries could have easily been sustained through innocent play outside. After a month-long legal battle, my grandmother lost, and I was stripped of the chance to see her for the remainder of my childhood.


This marked the first significant rift in the matriarchy, with my dad and Carolyn directly pitted against my grandmother. Carolyn, my stepmother, had always existed on the fringes of our family's inner circle. The question of how much of my abuse could be attributed to my father lingered in the background. While he had control over his actions and decisions, one couldn't help but wonder how much manipulation and misguided love played a role in his actions. I was acutely aware that Carolyn harbored no love for me. In fact, she went out of her way to make my life miserable.


For me, the absence of nurturing in my life left a void that I desperately sought to fill with love from others. This mirrored my father's complacency in keeping toxic people in his life. My first wife, Victoria, entered the picture as I was transitioning out of the military. Our marriage began with the understanding that I didn't want to continue my dentistry career if there were delays in her transition to America and our plans in Germany. However, jealousy and trust issues plagued our young relationship, leading to struggles in fully trusting each other. It became a complex mix of compromise, settling, and seeking balance. It took three wedding rings for me to realize that Victoria's jealousy, combined with my immaturity in addressing her concerns, made our relationship untenable, ultimately culminating in my first divorce.


Meanwhile, Terry had achieved remarkable success, amassing wealth through a combination of hard work, good fortune, and the unwavering support of his wife, Iva. Their partnership served as a shining example of teamwork. Iva had willingly postponed her own education to help Terry complete college and launch his first company. In return, Terry had supported her as she pursued her education and subsequently established her own successful company. Their union had given rise to a daughter, Sacia, who embodied the blend of high expectations from both parents, resulting in one of the kindest individuals one could ever meet.


The delicate balance between family dynamics and personal relationships has been a recurring theme in my life, shaped by the tumultuous history of my upbringing. As I navigate the complexities of love, trust, and forgiveness, I find myself reflecting on the fragile nature of bonds and the enduring impact of past traumas. It's a journey that has tested my resilience and resilience, ultimately leading me to a deeper understanding of the intricate web of connections that define our lives.




**Chapter 7: A House of Deceit**


My time living with Terry and his family before the fateful decision to hire the still-unknown kidnapper had its share of harrowing moments. One memory that stands out is when Jesse, my father, signed over guardianship to Terry when I was just 14. The justification was enrolling me in school, but in hindsight, it seems odd that the very next step was obtaining a passport. The dots didn't connect at the time. For nearly a year, I lived with one of the wealthiest families in Oklahoma, yet the stark disparity between Sacia's life and mine was undeniable. Despite being in the same grade, with just a three-month age difference, our upbringings couldn't have been more different. My life had been marked by abuse, shaping my communication skills in stark contrast to her sheltered upbringing.


Sacia had every gaming system imaginable in her room, but they gathered dust. When I dared to borrow one, she accused me of theft, promptly informed her parents, and to this day, among our friends, she claims I stole it—strange, considering I had virtually nothing at that time. They called me their son and plucked me from my home with just a few clothes, yet, as a high school kid with virtually nothing, I was accused of theft for using one gaming system. I struggled to make sense of it as a child and as a son. How could someone who called me their brother deny me the use of a gaming system when I had nothing? The ego-centric selfishness was bewildering.


At that time, it was trendy to add spoilers to car trunks, install massive 12-inch subwoofers, and decorate vehicles with large decals. During my "playboy" phase, I proudly displayed a giant Playboy bunny on my car's rear window. However, my uncle had me remove it the very next day. And to add insult to injury, someone broke into my car the day after that and stole my stereo system.


Of course, my uncle was quick to place the blame squarely on my shoulders, asserting that I had been associating with the wrong crowd. I had to endure the loss of my stereo system, and then Terry suggested that someone might be looking for me, noticing a car circling our house. It was then decided, for my safety, that I should no longer live with them. Keep in mind, I was just a 14-year-old high school student in Oklahoma City at the time. The idea of any real danger at that age seemed far-fetched, at least from my perspective.


This was the point at which the web of lies about me began to spin. My parents and Terry took it upon themselves to tell my friends and family that I was involved in a gang. Perhaps, if you looked at a 14-year-old who had a fondness for baby blue clothing and flashy jewelry and who was struggling with self-identity between the black and white communities, you could make that assumption. But it would have been just as easy for them to research and understand, yet it seemed simpler to label me and dismiss me, following the standard treatment they had grown accustomed to.




In the chapters of my life's story, there's a vivid recollection that stands out—a daring escape attempt from Casa by the Sea. It was a night fraught with tension and anticipation, a night when the prospect of freedom hung in the balance.


As our small group devised a plan to scale the towering basketball hoops and leap over the imposing 10-foot wall, my heart raced with a mixture of hope and fear. I wasn't alone in this venture; there were others, fellow souls yearning to break free from the oppressive confines of that place. I found myself in the second position to scale the wall, and as I looked over, a chilling sight greeted my eyes—rows of barbed wire awaited us on the other side.


The moment one of our group hit the ground, alarms erupted in a cacophonous chorus of warning. The family fathers, the enforcers of that bleak institution, were quick to react, their voices piercing the night as they bellowed at us to get down. It was a pivotal moment that demanded a choice, a choice that mirrored the very decisions my family members grappled with in their own lives.


In that critical moment at Casa by the Sea, I faced a profound dilemma, one that echoes with the complexities my family now grapples with in revealing the truth. On one side lay the tantalizing allure of freedom, a chance to escape the torment that had become our daily existence within those walls. It was an opportunity to break free from the clutches of the abusive program that had held us captive. 


However, on the other side of that towering wall loomed the specter of retribution—a vengeance that could be exacted by both our peers who had taken the daring leap and the family fathers who had subjected us to their control. The consequences of my actions were uncertain and potentially dire, much like the uncertainties my family faces today.


In that moment, fear's icy grip clutched at my heart, paralyzing my decision-making. The weight of the choice before me was immense. I stood there, perched on the precipice of choice, but ultimately, I chose not to jump. This decision was not taken lightly, and it would leave an indelible mark on my soul, a haunting echo of that pivotal night.


Now, as my family confronts the difficult decision to reveal the truth, they too are perched on the precipice of choice. They must grapple with the allure of truth and the potential for freedom from the shackles of deceit. But they are also acutely aware of the specter of retribution, not just from those within our family but from external forces as well. Terry and Iva's financial power looms large, and the consequences of exposing the truth could be financially ruinous.


In drawing this parallel, it becomes evident that the choices we face are never simple, and they carry profound consequences. My choice at Casa by the Sea left its mark on my life, just as the choice my family faces now will undoubtedly shape the course of our future. The struggle between the desire for freedom and the fear of retribution is a common thread that weaves through our experiences, past and present, and it underscores the complexity of the decisions we must make to find truth and reconciliation.


As my narrative unfolds, we transition to "zero day," a term synonymous with the commencement of basic training. It was the year 2004, and I had arrived at Fort Leonardwood, Missouri, where the freezing winds of that October night greeted us. Three drill sergeants stood in wait, their stern expressions and harsh commands creating an atmosphere of chaos and confusion.


I recognized the test for what it was—a trial to identify leaders and followers among us. I chose to take charge, to endure their push and pull, their insults and demands. In the world I had come from, this was a cakewalk. I meticulously arranged my platoon in alphabetical order, ensuring that everyone was in their correct place before I inserted myself.


My platoon earned the distinction of being first, a reward for our efficiency. However, the military's paradoxical nature meant that even good leadership could lead to punishment. And so, zero day continued, pushing us to our limits, setting the unyielding tone for the challenges that lay ahead in basic training.


This chapter in my life is a testament to the complex interplay of choices, fear, and the indomitable spirit that has shaped my remarkable story.


Leaving Jamaica and enlisting in the military was my attempt to break free from the vicious cycle of abuse that had haunted my past, and it represented a chance to reset my life. With the army, I harbored the hope of finding a brotherhood, a sense of belonging that had eluded me for so long. Little did I know that even within the structured confines of the military, I would not escape the harsh realities of racism and politics.


It became evident that, beyond the shared camaraderie of children who had endured abuse, the intricate complexities of human ideologies and political affiliations played a role in our lives. I grappled with questions of where I stood and with whom I stood. Thankfully, the military provided me with a battle buddy, and mine was Tommy Vo, a companion who would journey with me through the challenges ahead.


I chose to serve in the US Army as a combat medic, seeing it as a rite of passage that many men in our family had undertaken. My brother served as a Marine, I became a medic, my father had his time in the Army, my uncle Terry was in the Navy, and even my cousin Richard had his role as a patriot missile specialist.


Fast forward three years, and I found myself attached to the Vogelveigh dental unit in Kaiserslautern, Germany. It was here that I underwent a significant career change, reclassifying from a combat medic to a dental hygienist. This marked a shift in my military career as I transitioned to the role of maintaining the dental health of soldiers. During this period, I came to the realization that I despised having my hands inside unpleasant mouths and began contemplating another career shift.


As I prepared to leave the military, they facilitated my transition into civilian life by securing a position for me as an A/V technician for the DoubleTree hotel brand. This was a turning point in my life, as it was during this period that I experienced a miraculous reunion with Shameon, who held the position of front-of-house manager. The job offered decent pay, starting at $22 an hour back in 2007, and provided me with the opportunity to rekindle old friendships.


Among these friendships, I reconnected with one of my best friends and neighbors, Ryan Holler. Ryan had been a pillar of support during my junior high school years, and his family had extended their kindness to me by celebrating my birthday every summer at their Lakehouse. Since Ryan was an only child, his parents allowed him to invite friends, and he had always chosen Katie and me to share in those special moments. At that time, Ryan worked as a waiter, and despite my decent-paying job as a 21-year-old, he was making more money with fewer hours. This prompted me to consider a shift into the service industry.


During this period of transition and change, I began to hear the first faint whispers of what my friends believed had happened to me during my time away. These rumors prompted me to confront my father about my experiences for the first time. His chillingly callous response still sends shivers down my spine: "I don't care, you deserved it." I attempted to share my story, to make them understand the truth, but nobody believed me. Instead, they labeled me a liar and dismissed my claims as too incredible to be true.


The investigation to shut down all WWASP programs was an arduous journey that spanned a grueling 10 years, with only one school managing to survive to this day. Despite this significant progress, the final piece of closure I seek remains elusive: finding my kidnapper. Yet, the walls of silence remain steadfast within my family and church, as they adamantly refuse to reveal the identity of this person.


Throughout my tumultuous journey, there were two steadfast friends who provided unwavering support: Katie and Ryan. Katie, the lively tomboy of our trio, skillfully navigated the complexities of our teenage friendship, preserving our bond despite the challenges of adolescence. In the realm of family, these two were the only individuals I could trust and confide in.


One cherished memory from our youth was my 13th birthday celebration, a day filled with adventure and joy. We embarked on an evening of cliff jumping, followed by a delicious meal of fish and chips at a floating restaurant. It was a typical summer day for us—water sports, good food, and endless fun. This special occasion was celebrated with the company of Ryan's family.


The experience of celebrating birthdays with Ryan and Katie's families left an indelible mark on me, offering a glimpse of what a genuine, loving family could be. Now, as a parent myself, I am determined to provide the love and care that were often missing from my own childhood. My perspective on parenting has been profoundly shaped by my past, and I am resolute in my commitment to break the cycle of abuse and neglect.


My second marriage, although brief, was influenced by familial expectations and pressures. It was my grandmother who played a pivotal role in this union, passing down a precious family heirloom—a ring that had been cherished by generations of strong matriarchs. Her intentions were clear: this ring was meant for me. At the time, I did not fully grasp the weight of her words.


The day she gave me that ring remains etched in my memory. Despite being 80 years old, she tirelessly assisted me in moving a heavy couch. During this time, she confided in me that she had suffered a stroke, which had led my family to insist that she move in with them. This revelation marked my first significant concern for her health, but it tragically turned out to be the last time I saw her. Unbeknownst to anyone, she had been battling stage three breast cancer that had metastasized to her lungs, throat, and brain. She had kept her illness hidden, allowing the strokes to occur until it was too late.


Our final encounter was profoundly heart-wrenching. My brother and I visited her after her third stroke, bearing witness to the devastating toll of cancer. Her once robust presence had withered, and her body bore the visible scars of her illness. Yet, in her eyes, there was no fear—only a profound sense of strength. Despite her limited ability to speak, she conveyed essential messages: urging me to find happiness, encouraging reconciliation with my brother, and fervently expressing her deepest wish for our family to forgive each other.


Perhaps it is the absence of a new matriarch, the constant defamation of the monarch, or the subtle influence of a mastermind that has perpetuated division within our family. Nevertheless, I hold onto the hope that one day, we can overcome these challenges and emerge as a united family, healing the wounds of the past and forging a brighter future.






  

The only way to be safe is to be public






in Jamaica, the families usually consisted of about 22 kids. The daily schedule resembled cast by the sea. The only difference The food native to Jamaica was filled with plantains beans, rice and assorted jerks and Currys the school was difficult, because not only were the teachers unhelpful. The students wouldn’t take this time serious so I made sure to knock it out as fast as I could, and I graduated, and I think two months of testing. Graduated from tranquility bay. Jamaica We tested out of the unit of the California school district and general education standards, where even though I was here my junior and senior grades were perfect 4.0.




 On Sundays we had a three hour movie time where we would pick from my basket of VHS tapes. They were old movies, but this was the time of the week everybody waited for especially if you were level two this was the time also you received your candy bar your once a week dessert if you were level three during this time you were allowed to buy snacks from the commissary, which means you can have as many snacks as you want during this time only they structured this time to be the time every kid sat after and dreamed about Sunday movie night 




 will was somber huge round eyes, dark chocolate skin, slender kid from Chicago, reminded me of a funny Eddie Murphy, but bigger teeth big smile any time he talk to you it always looked like he had a small grin . Will is turning 18 and when that happens the facilities are no longer able to hold you since you are an adult and they recognize you as an adult so then they just open the doors and you are free to go will taught me everything I knew about dealmaking since he wasn’t as big of a guy as the other family fathers. He resorted often times to compromise. Shaquan he was a native Jamaican, a don, and also in this facility had the best hands in the entire compound,  he like to fight, and test everyone, so of course the new guy he would test me


 now you have to understand to get to Jamaica. You had to have done some bad shit. 
 There is a spectrum of American and global facilities. There was only one facility that was worse than Jamaica and that was Samoa. Samoa was closed one week prior, they had too many deaths which led to investigations on the cancel it, and it’s inevitable closure. The kids had to be shipped to other schools so during my integration, so I also get integrated with the Samoan kids. You can imagine the type of kids that are now coming into Jamaica. 


Out of all the guys in the compound from Samoa and tranquility, bay, Jamaica, Shaquan, what is the best. Has he tested me I think I did pretty good, I came from the background of Kyokushin karate. I was a pretty feisty, dude, smart but quick enough to not just take a beating. I think I hold my own. He won hundred percent kicked my ass but I did not get my ass beat and I think there’s a difference there, when we left the scrap, we are in pretty good terms. Actually, I would probably consider him my second best friend, even though I just got my ass beat.


 Why well when you’re in a situation like we’re in right how do kids test each other in a fight and you can fight dirty or you can fight clean . Shaquan fought clean and so did i and it wasn’t a quick fight. It lasted a little bit and after that fight to clean fighters you just have natural respect so there’s two points of respect that I got Was the initial Shaquan fight, 






 my first month at Tranquility Bay, Jamaica was welcomed at their Observation placement 30 days later I get introduced into my family where the family father tried to claim the man by saying your shit might’ve worked at Casa by the sea, but I won’t fly here in Jamaica grabbing my collar I remember, looking at the kids, family fathers face and making the instant decision to not backed out, I rushed him down the stairs falling on top of him the other family, father joined, and they both pulled me off, taking me back to my second 30 days and observation placement. It was required to ensure I wasn’t at the bottom of the food chain within our families inner circle. So when I fought shaquan, Will had already seen enough and made the decision to take me under his wing.


Riley. He was wills old best friend, white guy, very strong soccer player. He was technically next in line to be don but when will met me, Immediately, took that place. third fight, I beat Riley. I got the place of Don and then will start to teach me the ropes. What generally happens is the family Don’s job is to watch over the family.


Dillan made the transfer a few months laters. I ran into him in another visit to overwatch placement, this was when I made the decision to fight. Jamaicans don’t take too kindly to the gay community. when you enter the facilities the guards first pick an account of all of your items, my current value at the age of 16 and tranquility bay Jamaica was one plastic tote one two dollar bottle of shampoo, one pair of silicone sandals, two pairs of khaki shorts, two pairs of khaki shirts, a pillow and one sheet. The toothbrushes were disposable and they were locked away from us so we couldn’t have have them unless were in the bathroom for obvious weapon reasons 


Some kids pack too much because they don’t know what to expect, but with the first thing that happens is your stuff gets sifted through and the guards take anything they wanted.




 I had nothing which means I don’t have anything I couldn’t bribe them with, in normal circumstances this wouldn’t matter because as the Don, the family father, still away from here, I no longer had to defend myself against the family father because with the respect of the damn title, the family will always have your back the only time I would go to overwatch placement is in the fence of the family and of course that’s the Don’s job as well as fight for your family when I was gone, Riley would take over I was gone a lot. He loved his role.


As I assumed the face down chest on the ground, arms and legs together position, called this prone cross for me they Dylan in tears, face red black eye, bloody lip, and the guards left for lunch. I asked him know what happened. He told me he refused to drink the bleach and shampoo mixture. They tried to give him so they beat him Until he passed out. Mr. Matthews was the leader of all overwatch placement and the head father of the compound. His job was to ensure all kids were in line. Every time I was to be restrained Mr. Matthews was there a smile on his face, waiting to increase the punishment.


I’m not sure why this time was the line that finally crossed it for me, but as they were pouring the mixture down, Dylan’s throat and I was being restrained fingers broken four guards on each extremity. Mr. Matthews is looking down. I felt relief no more pain in fact, I calm washed over my body. The next day I wake up Dylan’s gone. I spend the next week by myself in overwatch placement awaiting my release. I return back to the family as usual, but Riley knows somethings different.


The Samoa school that closed brought one of the biggest kids I’ve seen with them. At least 6 foot this 17-year-old black haired German was the biggest kid I’ve ever seen to this day. His first day sounded a lot like mine. But it lasted a lot larger, I remember watching him walk through the gates, holding all of his bags in his hand and mattress as they walked him upstairs for his 30 day introductory overwatch placement. I remember that night watching him fight off 15 guards it literally took 15 guards to smash him against the corner with the mattresses and they held him there. They had to hold him there all night, until they got exhausted from having to get restrained, but seeing this German kid hold off 15 fathers himself, what is the last thing I needed to convince me there’s 200 kids per compound use around 20 kids per family which means around 20 family fathers at a time but each family has two more fathers that rotate night and day shift, and vacation so a total of around 70 fathers. On the compound at any time.




 of course stay with you throughout your time Being that there’s two shifts all the time if I was also sleep on compound but still the kids outnumber the family fathers so we should be able to fight them back. I wrote a note and a newer book family fathers watch this German kid look at what he does we can do the same, what do we mean we can right now is the time we just got an influx of Samoa kids right? We’re done let’s do it I don’t think I need to give additional context on the abuse in Jamaica so that this rate makes more sense Also, let’s segue into the first time around away in Jamaica, no no I didn’t. It was after I ran away it was the same time of the riot is when I was in the ocean then I ran away in Mexico different OK so good flashback to Mexico, then this recording I don’t even think their grammar when I was a castle by the sea they had 10 foot walls, there was only four runaways recorded at Casa by the seas history. When I jumped the wall I had to climb up the back of the basketball hoop extend my leg to the edge of the wall and jump. Here’s the problem since the walls are so high you don’t know what’s on the other side, what look like grass was actually barbed wire .
