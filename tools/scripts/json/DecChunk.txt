MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE
TO THE HONORABLE COURT:
I, Micheal Salmon, appearing Pro Se, respectfully move this Court to transfer venue for this
case from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to the United
States District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice and for the convenience
of all parties and witnesses, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a).

I. Introduction
This motion seeks to transfer venue to the District of Kansas, where both parties currently
reside, to reduce undue burdens on the parties and ensure efficient resolution of this matter.
The current venue in Missouri imposes significant logistical and financial challenges, making it
impractical for the parties and witnesses.

II. Factual Background
1. Parties� Residences:
? I, Micheal Salmon, reside at 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas, 66103.
? The Plaintiff, Crycella Freitag, resides in Pomona, Kansas.
2. Current Venue Impact:
? The current venue in Missouri is over four hours away from both parties� homes,
making travel difficult.
3. Efforts to Cooperate:
? I relocated from Missouri to Kansas to facilitate co-parenting and reduce travel
burdens, moving within 40 minutes of the Plaintiff.

4. Personal and Community Ties in Kansas:
? Our two-year-old son, Felix, attends a Montessori school and is actively involved
in community activities in Kansas, including church and friendships.

? Both families reside in Kansas, making it a more practical location for witness
testimonies.

5. Financial and Work Constraints:
? As a full-time single father, taking time off work to travel four hours each way for
court proceedings is unfeasible.
? The Plaintiff also works full time, making a Missouri venue equally burdensome.

III. Legal Standard
Under 28 U.S.C. � 1404(a), this Court may transfer a case for the convenience of the parties
and witnesses, and in the interest of justice. Factors to consider include:
1. The convenience of the parties and witnesses;
2. Access to sources of proof;
3. The plaintiff�s choice of forum;
4. Practical challenges of conducting the trial in the chosen forum;
5. Local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.

IV. Argument
1. Convenience of the Parties:
? Both parties reside in Kansas and would face significant hardship traveling to
Missouri for court appearances. Transferring the case to Kansas reduces
logistical burdens for both.
2. Convenience of Witnesses:
? Both parties� families and potential witnesses reside in Kansas, minimizing travel
for them and ensuring better participation.

3. Access to Evidence:
? Relevant evidence, such as Felix�s school records and community ties, is more
readily available in Kansas.

4. Local Interest:
? Kansas has a strong local interest in adjudicating this matter, as both parties and
their child reside and participate in the Kansas community.

5. Interest of Justice:

? Transferring the case aligns with fairness, reduces financial and logistical
hardships, and supports the co-parenting relationship.

V. Conclusion
For the reasons stated, I, Micheal Salmon, respectfully request that this Court transfer venue of
this case to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, in the interest of justice
and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses.

** Name ** Complaint Against Attorney for Professional Misconduct

Complaint Against Attorney for Professional Misconduct
To: The Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel
Subject: Formal Complaint Against Joshua L. Garrett
From: Micheal Salmon Address: 4120 Adams St, Kansas City, Kansas 66103
Date: December 16, 2024
Introduction
I am filing a formal complaint against attorney Joshua L. Garrett for unethical professional
conduct in his representation of my ex-partner, Crycella Freitag, in our ongoing child custody
matter concerning our son, Felix Salmon.
Specific Instances of Misconduct
1. Deliberate Obstruction of Co-Parenting Communication
In November 2024, Mr. Garrett advised Crycella to cease all communication with me, which
resulted in:
? Complete cessation of discussions about Felix's care and upbringing
? Refusal to provide financial information related to our child's support
? Intentional withholding of critical parenting and residential information
This advice has systematically undermined my ability to co-parent effectively and share
responsibilities for our child's well-being.
2. Facilitation of Manipulative Communication Tactics
Following Mr. Garrett's advice, our interactions have devolved into:
? Intentionally confrontational exchanges
? Calculated attempts to provoke or entrap me
? Deliberate creation of a hostile communication environment
3. Enabling False Safety Claims

A particularly egregious incident occurred when Crycella claimed to feel "unsafe" while:
? Voluntarily present in my home
? Situated in my bedroom
? In the presence of our children
When I sought clarification about this sudden claim, she refused to provide any substantive
explanation. This baseless allegation appears designed to:
? Damage my reputation as a parent
? Undermine my relationship with our children
? Weaponize unfounded safety concerns
4. Pattern of Racial Weaponization
This is not an isolated incident. Previously, Crycella attempted to:
? Take Felix across state lines without my knowledge or consent
? Involve law enforcement with fabricated claims of danger
? Leverage her position as a white woman to potentially harm my parental rights as a
Black father
Mr. Garrett's continued legal counsel appears to tacitly encourage and enable these harmful
tactics.
Violations of Professional Ethics
I believe Mr. Garrett has violated multiple professional conduct rules:
1. Rule 4.4 � Respect for Rights of Third Persons
? Providing advice that disregards the well-being of our child
? Causing significant harm to co-parental communication
2. Rule 1.2 � Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority
? Advising client to cease essential communication
? Actions directly contrary to the best interests of the minor child
3. Rule 8.4 � Misconduct
? Engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice
? Promoting tactics involving false allegations and manipulation

Impact on Family Dynamics
The consequences of Mr. Garrett's unethical guidance include:
? Emotional distress for our child, Felix

? Systematic destruction of co-parental communication
? Potential long-term psychological harm from persistent conflict
Requested Action
I formally request that the Bar Association:
? Thoroughly investigate Mr. Garrett's professional conduct
? Consider appropriate disciplinary measures
? Mandate cessation of tactics that obstruct meaningful co-parenting
Conclusion
As the primary goal of any custody arrangement should be the child's best interest, Mr. Garrett's
actions have systematically undermined this fundamental principle. I trust the Bar Association
will take these serious allegations seriously and take appropriate action.

** Name ** MOTION FOR HOME INSPECTION AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

MOTION FOR HOME INSPECTION AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
COMES NOW the Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully submits this Motion
for Home Inspection and Financial Disclosure in the above-captioned matter. In support of this
motion, Petitioner states as follows:
1. Basis for Motion
A. Concerns About Felix�s Safety and Well-being
1. The minor child, Felix Salmon, resides with the Respondent in a home shared with six
other adults and multiple pets, raising concerns about overcrowding and the
appropriateness of the living environment.
2. Petitioner has been denied access to Respondent's residence, limiting the ability to
assess Felix�s safety and well-being.
3. Specific concerns exist regarding potential exposure to discriminatory attitudes or
behaviors, based on past comments made by Respondent�s parent(s) in Petitioner's
presence.
4. To ensure Felix�s best interests are prioritized, Petitioner requests a home inspection
conducted by a court-appointed guardian ad litem (GAL) or other neutral investigator.
Such an inspection will evaluate the living conditions, including potential exposure to
discriminatory behaviors or symbols.
B. Lack of Reciprocity
1. Respondent has unrestricted access to Petitioner�s residence, which is clean, stable,
and safe for Felix.
2. Petitioner relocated five hours closer to Respondent to facilitate co-parenting but has
faced unequal access to Respondent�s home, hindering shared parenting efforts.
C. Financial Concerns

1. While residing with Petitioner for two years, Respondent failed to contribute to household
expenses such as rent and utilities.
2. Despite this, Respondent has been observed driving new vehicles and taking vacations,
raising questions about the prioritization of financial resources.
3. Petitioner seeks financial transparency to determine Respondent�s ability to support
Felix�s needs and address unresolved financial responsibilities.
D. Request for Basic Assurance
1. Petitioner seeks to confirm that Felix�s living environment is safe, clean, and conducive
to his well-being, free from discriminatory influences.
2. An objective inspection will provide the Court with an unbiased assessment of Felix�s
living conditions.
2. Legal Support
1. Under Missouri law (RSMo. � 452.375) and Kansas statutes (K.S.A. 23-3201), the
Court�s primary consideration in custody matters is the best interests of the child.
2. Courts have upheld home inspections as a valid tool to assess the suitability of a child�s
living environment. See Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982), establishing the
importance of safeguarding children�s welfare in custody disputes.
3. Financial disclosures are authorized under Missouri law (RSMo. � 452.340) and Kansas
statutes (K.S.A. 23-3203), which prioritize equitable financial contributions for child care.
3. Documentation and Evidence
1. Petitioner will provide sworn affidavits detailing:
? Instances of denied access to Respondent�s residence.
? Concerns regarding the living environment.
? Documented interactions suggesting potential exposure to discriminatory
attitudes.

2. Petitioner requests evaluations by licensed child welfare or psychological experts, in
addition to a home inspection, to provide a comprehensive assessment of Felix�s
well-being.
3. A detailed description of the six other adults residing in Respondent�s home, including
their roles and impact on Felix�s environment, will be included.
4. Financial Disclosure
Petitioner requests Respondent produce the following:
1. Tax returns for the past three years.
2. Bank statements for the past 12 months.
3. Proof of income, including pay stubs or other documentation.
4. A detailed accounting of expenses related to Felix�s care, including:

? Rent or mortgage payments.
? Utility bills.
? Childcare or education-related expenses.

5. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
1. Order a home inspection of Respondent�s residence by a neutral third party, such as a guardian
ad litem, court-appointed investigator, or appropriate child welfare agency, pursuant to Missouri
law (RSMo. � 452.375) and Kansas statutes (K.S.A. 23-3201).
2. Grant Petitioner limited access to Respondent�s residence for the sole purpose of verifying that
Felix�s living environment is safe and suitable for a minor child.
3. Require Respondent to provide photographic or documentary evidence that Felix�s living space
meets health and safety standards and is free from discriminatory influences.
4. Order Respondent to disclose financial records, including tax returns, bank statements, and an
accounting of recent large purchases, to clarify financial capabilities and ensure equitable support
for Felix.
5. Schedule a status conference to address these concerns and ensure timely resolution.
6. Grant any additional relief the Court deems just and proper.
