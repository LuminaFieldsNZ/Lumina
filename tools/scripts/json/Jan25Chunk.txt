STATEMENT OF WITNESS
Witness Name: Jozef Hanratty
Address: 4120 Adams St, Kansas City, Kansas 66103
COMES NOW the undersigned, Jozef Hanratty, and provides this witness statement regarding
the interactions and behavior of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards Micheal Lawrence Salmon.
The following statements are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief:
Gaslighting Behavior
1. On several occasions, I heard Crycella Elizabeth Freitag state to Micheal Lawrence
Salmon:
? "You don�t have the right to know anything about me, my finances, or where I
want to take Felix."
? "You don�t need to know where Felix stays, and I don�t need to show you pictures
of our time together."

2. These statements were made in a dismissive and confrontational tone, seemingly
intended to belittle Micheal and undermine his valid concerns about Felix's well-being.
Omission of Critical Information
1. Crycella Elizabeth Freitag explicitly refused to provide Micheal with vital information
about her finances and Felix�s care, stating:
? "No, until I get what I want, you won�t get any help from me."
2. Furthermore, she accused Micheal of making her feel "unsafe" without providing any
explanation or justification for these claims.
Lying and Interruptions
1. I observed Crycella frequently interrupting Micheal during discussions, accusing him of
lying and refusing to listen to his responses.
2. Despite these interruptions, Micheal remained calm and transparent in his
communication.

Transparency and Hospitality by Micheal Lawrence Salmon
1. Micheal invited Crycella into his home and maintained open communication to facilitate
co-parenting and transparency.
2. Despite his efforts, Crycella continued her dismissive and uncooperative behavior.
Conclusion
Based on my observations, the behavior exhibited by Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards
Micheal Lawrence Salmon was manipulative, dismissive, and designed to escalate tension
unnecessarily. I attest to witnessing the above-described events and am prepared to provide
additional information or testimony as required.

STATEMENT OF WITNESS
Witness Name: Anya Hill
Address: Resides with Crycella Freitag
COMES NOW, the undersigned, Anya Hill, and provides this witness statement regarding the
interactions and behavior of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag towards Micheal Lawrence Salmon, as
observed by me during the past few years. Although I am only 12 years old, I have lived with
Micheal for the last seven years and have witnessed much of what has occurred. The following
is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief:
1. Relationship with Micheal Lawrence Salmon:
? While Micheal is not my biological father, he has been a significant figure in my
life for the last seven years. He has always been there for me in a supportive and
caring way, helping me with school, providing for me, and offering guidance when
I needed it.
? He has made efforts to be involved in my life, and I have always appreciated his
support. Although I do not consider him my "father" in the legal sense, I do see
him as a positive male role model and someone who has always treated me with
kindness and respect.

2. Observations of Crycella Elizabeth Freitag:
? I have noticed that Crycella frequently speaks negatively about Todd Hill, my
biological father, in front of me. This makes me uncomfortable, as it seems like
she is trying to turn me against him. I don�t like hearing these comments, as they
only make me feel conflicted and upset.
? Crycella has also discouraged me from having a positive relationship with
Micheal, even though he has always treated me well. On several occasions, she
has dismissed my feelings when I express how much I appreciate Micheal�s
support in my life.

3. Disagreement and Combative Behavior:
? Crycella often becomes combative when I express positive things about Micheal,
which makes me feel like I can�t talk freely about my own experiences. If I
mention that I feel comfortable with him or that he has been helpful to me, she
gets upset and tries to change the subject or criticize him.

? This has made it difficult for me to maintain a healthy and open relationship with
Micheal. I know he has always been there for me, but Crycella�s behavior
interferes with that.

4. The Role of Micheal Lawrence Salmon in My Life:
? While he is not my legal father, Micheal has always been there to offer support
and care. He�s made sure I had what I needed, and he has been involved in my
life when I needed him. He has helped me with schoolwork, been present for
important events, and has always shown me kindness.
? I wish I could see Micheal more often and without Crycella�s interference. He has
always tried to be a positive influence in my life, and I believe he cares for me,
even though we don�t have a traditional father-daughter relationship.

Conclusion:
Based on my observations, Micheal has been a caring and supportive person in my life.
Crycella�s behavior has often made it difficult for me to maintain a positive relationship with him,
and I believe that her treatment of him has been unfair. Additionally, I feel uncomfortable with
the negative things she says about my biological father, Todd Hill, as it has created unnecessary
tension. I wish that I could freely express my feelings without fear of upsetting Crycella.

** Name ** WITNESS STATEMENT / PARENTING TIME LOG

WITNESS STATEMENT / PARENTING TIME LOG
Date: Thursday, December 26, 2024
Interaction:
? Asked Crycella when she would like to see Felix again. After three hours of arguing, she
chose Saturday but refused to provide an itinerary.
? Expressed concerns regarding supervision and requested a chaperone for future visits
due to a prior incident where Felix returned cold and shaking after being outside for over
four hours in inappropriate clothing. Crycella refused to agree to any supervision or
provide photos of Felix at events.
Date: Friday, December 27, 2024
Interaction:
? Received no updates from Crycella regarding Saturday plans as promised.
Date: Saturday, December 28, 2024
Interaction:
? 8:00 AM: Contacted Crycella to confirm her plans to see Felix. She stated she still had
no specific plans and could not provide any details.
? 8:30 AM: Informed Crycella she could have Felix from 3:00 PM until bedtime and
explained that if she did not show up, it would be her responsibility. She agreed to this
arrangement and again told me it was because of her broken car.
Impact:
1. Lost opportunity for personal time with friends due to last-minute planning changes.
2. Missed potential side jobs, resulting in lost income opportunities critical as a single
father.
3. Created unnecessary stress and uncertainty for Felix due to Crycella�s lack of reliability.
Conclusion
Crycella�s repeated failure to provide clear plans and her reliance on transportation issues as an
excuse has significantly impacted my ability to plan my life and care for Felix. Her inconsistent
visitation and lack of accountability place undue strain on me as a single father and affect Felix�s
emotional well-being.

I am prepared to provide further details or testimony to support this log.

** Name ** MOTION FOR CHANGE OF JUDGE

MOTION FOR CHANGE OF JUDGE
COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Petitioner, and respectfully moves this Court for a
change of judge pursuant to Rule 51.05 of the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure. In support of
this motion, Petitioner states as follows:
1. The presiding judge, Honorable Judge Matt Alan Selby, has demonstrated bias and
prejudice against Petitioner by refusing to review key evidence, including lease
agreements and supporting text messages.
2. Judge Selby has allowed knowingly false testimony from witnesses, affecting the
fairness of the custody proceedings.
3. Judge Selby�s failure to consider relevant evidence has led to an unjust ruling that is not
in the best interest of the minor child.
4. Missouri law entitles litigants to a fair and impartial judge, and Petitioner believes Judge
Selby�s actions indicate an inability to render an unbiased decision.
5. For these reasons, Petitioner respectfully requests that a new judge be assigned to this
case.




** Date ** Jan 31, 2024
** Name ** Letter to Judge Matt Alan Selby

Dear Judge Matt Alan Selby,
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request clarification regarding a
recent ruling in this case, specifically the acceptance of evidence that I believe to be fraudulent
or perjured, as well as the exclusion of opposing evidence presented to disprove this.
To ensure accuracy and transparency in the record, I respectfully request a written explanation
of the reasoning behind the decision to admit fraudulent or perjured evidence into the record, as
well as the rationale for excluding the evidence presented to challenge its validity. Specifically, I
refer to the following:
1. Proof of residency (Lease Agreement)
2. Text messages acknowledging the lease agreement
3. Text messages proving February Tenancy
4. Three instances of Mr. Garrett coaching Crycella with the phrase �Watch his reaction�
while introducing known fraudulent evidence
5. Crycella Freitag and Jozef Hanratty�s conspiracy to create a false misrepresentation of
my character
6. Crycella Freitag and Jozef Hanratty�s conspiracy to falsely claim Jozef is not my
landlord, despite their knowledge of Jozef�s misrepresentation
7. Crycella Freitag and Mr. Garrett knowingly submitting false testimony in an attempt to
frame me for perjury, with the knowledge that Jozef was my landlord and they were
working with him without my knowledge
This request is made to ensure fairness and clarity in the ongoing proceedings. I trust you will
give careful consideration to this matter, as I seek to uphold the integrity of the legal process
and ensure that no unjust outcomes arise from compromised decision-making.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to your timely response.

MOTION FOR COMMUNICATION ORDER
COMES NOW Micheal Lawrence Salmon ("Respondent") and respectfully moves this Court to
issue an order requiring effective and consistent communication between Crycella Elizabeth
Freitag ("Petitioner") and Respondent for matters pertaining to the care and well-being of their
minor child, Felix Salmon. In support of this Motion, Respondent states as follows:
I. Introduction
This Motion is brought to ensure the welfare and safety of Felix Salmon by establishing clear
communication protocols between the parties regarding his care, health, and activities during
Petitioner�s parenting time.
II. Factual Basis
1. Failure to Provide Necessary Information
? During Felix�s recent visit with Petitioner, he returned to Respondent exhibiting
symptoms of vomiting and illness. When asked about his diet and activities,
Petitioner refused to disclose any relevant information, hindering Respondent�s
ability to provide appropriate care and treatment.

2. Ongoing Communication Issues
? Petitioner has consistently refused to communicate effectively or provide timely
and accurate information regarding Felix�s well-being. This includes:
? Failing to notify Respondent of activities or locations during her parenting
time.
? Refusing to answer questions regarding Felix�s diet, health, or exposure
to unsafe environments.
? Creating unnecessary stress and instability for Felix due to lack of
cooperation and transparency.
3. Pattern of Neglect and Poor Co-Parenting
? As outlined in Respondent�s prior Motion for Supervised Visitation, Petitioner�s
behavior demonstrates a pattern of neglect and poor judgment, including:
? Failing to provide adequate clothing during outings in freezing weather.
? Exposing Felix to unsafe living conditions and toxic family dynamics.

4. Impact on Felix�s Well-Being

? The lack of communication directly impacts Felix�s health and emotional stability,
as Respondent is unable to make informed decisions regarding his care when
necessary details are withheld.

III. Legal Basis
Missouri law emphasizes the importance of cooperative co-parenting and prioritizing the child�s
best interests in custody and visitation matters. A communication order is essential to ensure
both parties can fulfill their parental responsibilities effectively.
IV. Requested Relief
WHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that this Court:
1. Order both parties to communicate promptly and effectively regarding:
? Felix�s health, diet, and activities during parenting time.
? Any incidents, injuries, or illnesses occurring while Felix is in the care of either
party.
? Specific times and locations for pick-up and drop-off to ensure consistency.

timeframe (e.g., 24 hours).

communicate.

** Name ** MOTION FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF

MOTION FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF
COMES NOW Micheal Lawrence Salmon ("Respondent") and respectfully moves this Court to
grant emergency relief requiring that all visitation between Crycella Elizabeth Freitag
("Petitioner") and the minor child, Felix Salmon, be supervised by Respondent until further order
of the Court. This request is made to protect the health, safety, and well-being of Felix Salmon in
light of repeated incidents demonstrating a lack of appropriate care by Petitioner. In support of
this Motion, Respondent states as follows:
I. Introduction
This Motion is brought pursuant to Missouri law, which authorizes the Court to take emergency
measures to safeguard the welfare of a minor child. The relief requested herein is necessary to
address ongoing concerns about Petitioner�s ability to provide a safe and stable environment for
Felix Salmon.
II. Factual Basis
1. Recent Incident of Illness After Visitation
? On January 7, 2025, Felix returned from visitation with Petitioner exhibiting
symptoms of vomiting and illness.
? When Respondent inquired about Felix�s diet and activities during the visit,
Petitioner refused to provide any information, hindering Respondent�s ability to
ensure appropriate medical care and determine the cause of the illness.

2. History of Unsafe Practices
? As outlined in Respondent�s prior Motion for Supervised Visitation, Petitioner has
engaged in a pattern of neglect and poor judgment, including:
? Failing to dress Felix appropriately for freezing weather during a zoo visit,
resulting in symptoms of hypothermia.
? Exposing Felix to unsafe living conditions in a crowded household with
multiple animals, individuals with violent tendencies, and accessible
firearms and drugs.
3. Refusal to Communicate

? Petitioner routinely refuses to share essential information about Felix�s health,
diet, and activities during her parenting time, creating significant risks to Felix�s
well-being.

4. No Desire to Restrict Parenting Time
? Respondent seeks to ensure that Felix continues to maintain a relationship with
Petitioner but under conditions that prioritize his health and safety. Supervision by
Respondent will allow for appropriate oversight while preserving Petitioner�s
visitation rights.

III. Legal Basis
Missouri law provides that courts may grant emergency relief when a child�s safety is at risk.
Courts are empowered to issue orders to ensure that custody and visitation arrangements serve
the best interests of the child.
IV. Requested Relief
WHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that this Court:
1. Order that all visitation between Petitioner and Felix Salmon be supervised by
Respondent until further order of the Court.
2. Require Petitioner to:
? Provide detailed information about Felix�s health, diet, and activities during her
parenting time.
? Communicate promptly with Respondent regarding any incidents, injuries, or
illnesses involving Felix.

COMBINED MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE CUSTODY MODIFICATION AND SANCTIONS
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE COURT:
Comes now Micheal Lawrence Salmon, the Plaintiff, and respectfully moves this Court to
immediately retract and modify the custody order entered on December 3, 2024 due to
fraudulent testimony, procedural misconduct, and unethical legal tactics that have caused
substantial and unjust harm. Plaintiff further requests this Court impose sanctions against
Defendant Joshua Garrett for his deliberate role in misleading the Court and obstructing justice.
In support of this motion, Plaintiff states as follows:

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff has been subjected to fraudulent testimony and unethical legal maneuvers that have
deprived him of his parental rights and inflicted significant financial and emotional harm. This
motion seeks urgent relief by requesting the immediate reversal of the unjust custody order and
financial sanctions against Defendant Joshua Garrett for his misconduct in these proceedings.
Furthermore, Plaintiff explicitly informed Judge Matt Alan Selby during the hearing that he
possessed a contradictory lease agreement and supporting text messages disproving the false
claims made by Defendants. However, Judge Selby refused to review this evidence, thereby
rendering a decision based on knowingly incomplete and misleading testimony.

GROUNDS FOR RELIEF
A. FRAUDULENT TESTIMONY AND MISREPRESENTATION OF LIVING SITUATION
1. Jozef Hanratty falsely testified that Plaintiff was an unfit parent despite only knowing
Plaintiff for 30 days.
2. Hanratty admitted under oath to harassing Plaintiff and interfering with his custody,
yet the Court still allowed his testimony to dictate custody arrangements.

3. Court filings falsely described Plaintiff as "homeless" despite Plaintiff having a valid lease
agreement and multiple stable housing options.
4. Plaintiff attempted to present his lease agreement and supporting text messages to
Judge Matt Alan Selby, who refused to review the documents, leading to an unfair and
unfounded ruling.
B. UNETHICAL CONDUCT AND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE BY JOSHUA GARRETT
1. Joshua Garrett knowingly presented false and misleading testimony to the Court, failing
in his duty as an officer of the Court.
2. Garrett conspired with Jozef Hanratty and Crycella Freitag to fabricate a crisis, leading to
an emergency custody order on December 3, 2024, based on false pretenses.
3. Garrett deliberately obstructed Plaintiff�s ability to respond to legal actions by refusing to
communicate via email and relying on postal mail to delay essential court
correspondence.
4. Garrett actively pressured Plaintiff�s landlord to remove him from his residence,
manufacturing instability to be used against Plaintiff in custody proceedings.
C. COORDINATED INTERFERENCE AND MALICIOUS LITIGATION
1. Defendants colluded to manipulate custody proceedings through perjury and falsified
claims, directly harming Plaintiff�s parental rights.
2. As a result of Defendants� fraudulent actions, Plaintiff has suffered:
? Unjustified loss of custody and parental time.
? Severe financial hardship, including loss of internet access essential for work
and legal proceedings.
? Emotional distress due to the disruption of his child�s well-being and false
allegations against him.

REQUESTED RELIEF
Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
1. Immediately vacate and modify the custody order based on the fraudulent testimony and
misrepresentation of facts.
2. Grant primary custody to Plaintiff, as it is in the best interest of the child and necessary
to rectify the injustice caused by Defendants� fraudulent conduct.
3. Conduct a new custody evaluation or hearing to properly assess the current
circumstances, ensuring a fair and unbiased review.
4. Impose financial sanctions on Joshua Garrett for his unethical conduct and deliberate
interference in Plaintiff�s custody rights.
5. Order Crycella Freitag and Joshua Garrett to reimburse Plaintiff for legal expenses and
financial damages incurred due to their fraudulent actions.

6. Disqualify Joshua Garrett from further representing Crycella Freitag due to his pattern of
unethical behavior.
7. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.
