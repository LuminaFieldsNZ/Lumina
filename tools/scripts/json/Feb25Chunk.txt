** Name ** Formal Complaint Against Clerk Elizabeth Lacy

Subject: Formal Complaint Against Clerk Elizabeth Lacy � Stone County Circuit Court
To Whom It May Concern,
I am submitting this formal complaint against Elizabeth Lacy, Domestic Clerk of the Stone
County Circuit Court, regarding her deliberate obstruction of my appeal process in case
24SN-DR00104. The actions taken by Ms. Lacy violate Missouri Supreme Court Rule 81.12,
impede my due process rights, and create an unlawful financial barrier to my ability to appeal.
Specific Allegations of Misconduct
1. Misrepresentation of Appellate Record Requirements
Missouri Rule 81.12(a) and (c) states that an appellant may submit a statement of evidence in
lieu of a full transcript when the cost is prohibitive. However, Ms. Lacy falsely stated that I am
required to pay for the entire transcript and cannot submit a partial record. This is a blatant
misrepresentation of the rule and an attempt to obstruct my access to the appeals process.
2. Financially Obstructing My Right to Appeal
Ms. Lacy has created an artificial financial barrier to my appeal by:
? Falsely stating that I must pay for a full transcript at an inflated rate ($3.50 per page,
totaling over $1,000) despite the availability of alternative means under Rule 81.12(c).
? Demanding an uncertain "deposit" without disclosing how final costs are determined,
making it impossible to budget or plan for the appeal.
? Withholding information on cost waivers and alternative documentation that could allow
me to proceed without an excessive financial burden.
These actions directly contradict Missouri�s established appellate procedures and constitute an
abuse of administrative discretion.
3. Improper Handling of My Appeal Filing
? Ms. Lacy has delayed and obstructed my appeal by failing to promptly process my
Notice of Appeal and attaching unnecessary financial conditions before forwarding my
case to the Missouri Court of Appeals.
? She has refused to provide clear guidance on the accepted means of payment for the
appeal filing fee, further delaying my ability to move forward.
4. Acting Outside the Scope of Her Duties
The role of a clerk is ministerial�meaning clerks must process filings according to procedural
rules without imposing additional conditions that are not required by law. Ms. Lacy is

improperly inserting herself into judicial decision-making by wrongfully interpreting appellate
rules and creating conditions that prevent me from filing in a fair and timely manner.
Requested Actions & Remedies
Given the above violations, I request the following:
1. A formal investigation into Ms. Lacy�s conduct, including a review of whether she
has similarly obstructed other pro se litigants.
2. Immediate processing of my Notice of Appeal without unlawful financial barriers.
3. Clarification on the use of a Statement of Evidence in lieu of a transcript, per Rule
81.12(c), to ensure compliance with appellate procedures.
4. Disciplinary action against Ms. Lacy for administrative misconduct if it is found that
she has intentionally misrepresented legal requirements.
Failure to address this misconduct will leave me with no choice but to escalate this matter to
higher judicial oversight bodies, including the Missouri Commission on Retirement,
Removal, and Discipline of Judges, and to pursue legal remedies to enforce my right to due
process.
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and request a written response detailing the
steps being taken to address these concerns.

** Name ** MOTION FOR EVIDENCE SUBMISSION, NOTICE OF JUDICIAL ERROR, AND FORMAL INCLUSION OF KELLY TRUELOVE, and JOZEF HANRATTY IN CASE

MOTION FOR EVIDENCE SUBMISSION, NOTICE OF JUDICIAL ERROR, AND FORMAL INCLUSION OF KELLY TRUELOVE, and JOZEF HANRATTY IN CASE
COMES NOW, Micheal Salmon, Petitioner, and submits the following evidence and motion to
formally tie Kelly Truelove to the present case, document procedural manipulation, and highlight
judicial oversight regarding perjury committed by Jozef Hanratty and Attorney Joshua Garrett. In
support of this motion, Petitioner states as follows:
1. Evidence Submission: Notice to Pay or Quit from Kelly Truelove
? Petitioner received a "Notice to Pay or Quit for Non-Payment of Rent" from Kelly's legal
counsel.
? This notice is the first form of communication received from her, despite Petitioner's
multiple attempts to arrange payment, which have been systematically obstructed.
? The notice states that April will be the final month of tenancy but fails to specify the
exact amount owed, demonstrating bad-faith intent rather than an attempt to resolve
the matter.
? The notice also declares that legal action will begin on April 1st, aligning with
Petitioner's preparation to file in Kansas, where proper jurisdiction exists.
2. Procedural Manipulation and Inclusion of Kelly Truelove
? Kelly Truelove has intentionally delayed communications and manipulated
circumstances to gain an unfair advantage in litigation.
? Given that housing and financial stability are directly relevant to this custody case, her
involvement is critical and should be officially acknowledged by the court.
? The court should note her role in strategically delaying payments and controlling
financial leverage to influence ongoing legal proceedings unfairly.

3. Judicial Error & Perjury by Jozef Hanratty and Joshua Garrett
? Jozef Hanratty provided knowingly false testimony, which has been acknowledged as
false by the court but was still used to justify an unfavorable temporary order.
? Attorney Joshua Garrett has facilitated this perjury and has misrepresented facts before
the court.
? The judge�s failure to act on this perjury while continuing to enforce orders based on
knowingly false testimony constitutes a clear legal oversight and miscarriage of
justice.
? Petitioner requests that the court formally address these infractions and reconsider
rulings that have been improperly influenced by false testimony.
4. Relief Requested
Petitioner respectfully requests the following actions be taken:
1. Formally include Kelly Truelove as a relevant party to this case, given her
demonstrated impact on Petitioner's financial stability and living situation.
2. Acknowledge and rectify the judicial oversight that has allowed perjury by Jozef
Hanratty and misrepresentation by Joshua Garrett to affect prior rulings.
3. Reevaluate all temporary custody orders that were based on false statements and
manipulated evidence.
4. Allow Petitioner to submit all relevant financial records and prior communication
attempts as evidence of Kelly Truelove�s manipulative tactics in this case.

** Name ** MOTION TO VACATE VOID ORDERS FOR FRAUD & EMERGENCY CUSTODY TRANSFER

IN THE MATTER OF THE CUSTODY OF FELIX SALMON, A MINOR CHILD
MOTION TO VACATE VOID ORDERS FOR FRAUD & EMERGENCY CUSTODY TRANSFER
COMES NOW, Respondent/Counter-Petitioner, MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, and moves this Honorable Court to vacate the temporary custody order granted in favor of Petitioner/Counter-Respondent, CRYCELLA ELIZABETH FREITAG, on the basis of:
Improper venue and fraudulently established jurisdiction;
Material misrepresentations to the Court;
Ongoing violations of parental rights.
In support thereof, Respondent/Counter-Petitioner states as follows:
I. IMPROPER VENUE & FRAUDULENTLY ESTABLISHED JURISDICTION
Pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), jurisdiction is determined by the child�s primary residence for the six (6) months immediately preceding the filing of a custody action.
Felix Salmon never met this statutory requirement in Stone County:
He resided in Branson, Missouri, for less than six months (May 17, 2024 � November 13, 2024).
Stone County was never his home county, nor was it the legal domicile of either parent.
His extended stay in Stone County was the result of intentional deception and fraud perpetrated by Petitioner/Counter-Respondent.
Petitioner/Counter-Respondent fraudulently manipulated jurisdiction by:
Knowingly misrepresenting her intentions to cohabit with Respondent/Counter-Petitioner, inducing him to remain in Branson under false pretenses.
Deliberately providing misleading assurances to create the appearance of a legitimate connection to Stone County.
Strategically delaying separation to fabricate a legal basis for venue and jurisdiction in a county that would otherwise have no claim.
Attached hereto as Exhibit I are text messages providing incontrovertible proof of this deception.
As a result of this fraudulently manufactured jurisdiction, this Court improperly exercised authority over Felix�s custody and granted temporary custody orders that lack legal standing.
Furthermore:
Missouri no longer has continuing jurisdiction under the UCCJEA, as both parties have now established residence in Kansas.
The proper jurisdiction for all custody proceedings is Wyandotte County, Kansas, where Felix has resided for the majority of his life and where both parents now reside.
II. VIOLATIONS OF COURT-ORDERED PARENTING TIME
Petitioner/Counter-Respondent has repeatedly and willfully violated court-ordered parenting time, including:
Obstructing court-permitted phone calls by speaking over Respondent/Counter-Petitioner and raising her voice, preventing meaningful parental contact (video documentation available).
Refusing to facilitate in-person visits as required by the court order.
Actively interfering with court-ordered visitation, including:
Failing to make any good-faith effort to facilitate Layne Project exchanges.
Refusing all reasonable alternatives, including public locations, police station handoffs, and third-party pickups.
Explicitly stating that even family and friends of Respondent/Counter-Petitioner are not allowed to see Felix (See attached video correspondence as Exhibit H).
Denial of Visitation:
The judge�s order granting Respondent/Counter-Petitioner only two hours of visitation on Saturdays was already excessively restrictive and not in the best interests of Felix.
Despite this minimal allowance, Crycella Freitag has denied even this limited visitation, further alienating Respondent/Counter-Petitioner from his child.
Isolation from Family and Friends:
Crycella Freitag has also refused to allow Respondent/Counter-Petitioner�s friends and family to see Felix, effectively isolating him from his extended support network.
This is not only unfair to Respondent/Counter-Petitioner but also detrimental to Felix�s well-being and emotional development.
Despite Respondent/Counter-Petitioner�s continuous efforts to comply, including numerous phone calls, emails, and a filled-out online form, Layne Project scheduling was unavailable until Monday, February 17, 2025.
Petitioner/Counter-Respondent�s refusal to cooperate constitutes intentional alienation and bad faith. (See attached video correspondence as Exhibit G).
III. FALSE CLAIMS OF HOUSING INSTABILITY
The primary basis for the custody transfer was an alleged lack of stable housing, which was false and misleading.
Respondent/Counter-Petitioner�s primary residence at 4120 Adams Street, Kansas City, Kansas, was never unstable.
Additional verified housing options included:
12302 W 129th Terrace, Overland Park, KS 66213 (Rent-Free).
7408 E 57th Street, Kansas City, MO (Rent-Free).
Church-provided accommodations and the ability to rent immediately through VRBO, Roomster, and RoomUp.
The continued denial of custody based on false claims of housing instability is legally unfounded and arbitrary.
IV. JUDICIAL ERRORS & BAD FAITH LITIGATION
Petitioner/Counter-Respondent, with the assistance of her counsel, misled this Court to obtain custody under false pretenses.
This Court has willfully ignored jurisdictional defects and failed to correct its errors, violating Respondent/Counter-Petitioner�s due process rights.
The orders issued under this false jurisdiction are void ab initio and must be vacated.
Respondent/Counter-Petitioner demands a writ of mandamus compelling judicial correction to remedy this miscarriage of justice.
V. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Respondent/Counter-Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
Vacate the temporary custody order due to improper venue and fraudulently established jurisdiction under the UCCJEA.
Issue an immediate stay on enforcement of the existing custody order.
Grant emergency custody transfer to Respondent/Counter-Petitioner.
Refer this matter for judicial review due to clear procedural errors and potential violations of Missouri parental rights statutes.
Hold Petitioner/Counter-Respondent in contempt of court for repeated violations of court-ordered parenting time.
Schedule an expedited hearing within seven (7) days under emergency authority.
Award Respondent/Counter-Petitioner compensation in an amount not less than $5,000 for emotional distress and legal costs incurred due to Petitioner/Counter-Respondent�s fraudulent and obstructive actions.

** Name ** PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

COMES NOW, Petitioner MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a Writ of Mandamus directing the Honorable MATT ALAN SELBY, Circuit Judge of Stone County, Missouri, to:
Perform his mandatory duty to rule on pending motions and address legal errors;
Vacate all orders issued under improper jurisdiction;
Transfer this matter to the appropriate Kansas court under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA); and
Restore Petitioner�s parental rights and enforce proper visitation with his son, Felix Salmon.
In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:
I. INTRODUCTION
This case presents a clear failure by the Stone County Circuit Court to perform its mandatory duties under the law. The presiding judge has:
Failed to rule on multiple motions filed by Petitioner, including motions to dismiss for improper venue and motions to transfer jurisdiction under the UCCJEA; It is well-established that a trial court has a non-discretionary duty to rule on properly filed motions. See State ex rel. Jones v. McGhee, 639 S.W.2d 60 (Mo. Ct. App. 1982) (holding that a judge must rule on pending motions within a reasonable time). Failure to do so constitutes a denial of due process, warranting mandamus relief.
Maintained jurisdiction over this case despite clear evidence that Stone County, Missouri, lacks jurisdiction;
Allowed the Real Party in Interest, Crycella Freitag, to repeatedly violate court-ordered visitation and alienate Petitioner from his son;
Allowed procedural misconduct that has placed Petitioner at a severe disadvantage, effectively denying him due process.
This Court must intervene to correct these injustices and ensure that legal procedures are followed.
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS
A. Improper Jurisdiction and Venue
Felix Salmon resided in Stone County, Missouri, for less than six months (May 17, 2024 � November 13, 2024). Under RSMo � 452.700 and K.S.A. 23-37,201, jurisdiction vests in the state where the child has resided for six consecutive months immediately preceding the commencement of the action. Felix did not meet this threshold in Stone County. Wyandotte County is the only legitimate claim to jurisdiction, rendering the orders of the Stone County Circuit Court void ab initio.
Pursuant to the UCCJEA (RSMo � 452.700 et seq.), jurisdiction is proper only where the child has lived for six consecutive months prior to legal action.
Both parents currently reside in Kansas, making Kansas the appropriate forum for this case under the UCCJEA.
Crycella Freitag engaged in jurisdictional manipulation by delaying separation and creating a temporary residence in Stone County Missouri to fabricate a legal basis for venue.
B. Judge�s Failure to Address Motions
Petitioner has filed multiple motions, including:
Motion to Dismiss for Improper Venue;
Motion to Transfer Jurisdiction to Kansas;
Motion to Enforce Visitation;
Motion for Protection of Minor Witness from Undue Influence (For my daughter Anya, whom I have raised for seven years and have not seen for three months);
Motion for Emergency Relief (Documented three instances where Crycella has been unsafe with Felix, addressing direct concerns regarding his safety);
Motion for Communication Order (Petitioner had to disclose all information in interrogatories, whereas Crycella was able to withhold critical information, including her financial obligations and residency);
Motion to Sanction Petitioner and Petitioner�s Counsel for Unethical and Obstructive Conduct (Addressing misconduct by Mr. Garrett);
Motion to Issue Subpoena for Minor Witness Testimony (Attempted to obtain testimony from Anya before further manipulation by Crycella);
Motion for Home Inspection and Financial Disclosure (Petitioner has been denied any information regarding Felix's living conditions, has not been allowed to inspect his sleeping arrangements, and has been left without knowledge while Crycella retains access to Petitioner�s home).
The judge has failed to rule on these motions, leaving Petitioner without recourse and violating his right to due process. The United States Supreme Court has long held that 'The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.' Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). The failure to rule on pending motions deprives Petitioner of this right, necessitating intervention from this Court.
C. Denial of Visitation and Parental Rights
The judge granted Petitioner only up to two hours of supervised visitation on Saturdays up to Crycella�s discretion.
Crycella Freitag has repeatedly denied visitation in violation of court orders.
Felix is currently living in a household with eight people and 14 animals, raising concerns about his well-being and stability.
Crycella Freitag has refused to allow Petitioner�s family and friends access to Felix, further alienating him from his support network.
D. Intentional Financial Hardship Created by Crycella Freitag
Crycella Freitag has failed to contribute financially to Felix�s care.
She has engaged in legal maneuvers intended to drain Petitioner�s financial resources, forcing him to proceed pro se.
The court's failure to address these issues has compounded the prejudice against Petitioner.
III. LEGAL ARGUMENT
A. Failure to Perform Mandatory Duties
A trial court has a mandatory duty to rule on properly filed motions. The failure to do so deprives Petitioner of his constitutional right to due process.
B. Violation of the UCCJEA
The UCCJEA (RSMo � 452.700 et seq.) mandates that jurisdiction is proper where the child has lived for six consecutive months. Felix has not met this threshold in Missouri, making the continued assertion of jurisdiction by Stone County a clear legal error.
C. Clear Abuse of Discretion
The judge's refusal to transfer jurisdiction despite the clear mandates of the UCCJEA constitutes an abuse of discretion.
D. No Adequate Remedy at Law
Petitioner has exhausted all available legal remedies, filing multiple motions that remain unanswered. The lack of court action leaves Petitioner with no adequate legal remedy other than this writ.
IV. RELIEF REQUESTED
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
Issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the Honorable MATT ALAN SELBY to:
a) Rule on all pending motions within 14 days;
b) Vacate all orders issued in excess of jurisdiction; and
c) Transfer this matter to Kansas in accordance with the UCCJEA.
Restore Petitioner�s parental rights and enforce meaningful visitation with Felix Salmon.
Stay enforcement of any orders granting sole custody to Crycella Freitag pending resolution of this writ.
Grant Petitioner�s request for a fee waiver (see below).
Civil Rights Violations under 42 U.S.C. � 1983
Judge Selby's deliberate failure to rule on motions and enforce parental rights
Constitutional violations of due process
Deprivation of parental rights under color of law These violations can yield significant damages, including punitive damages against state actors
Tort Claims Against Opposing Party
Intentional infliction of emotional distress
Fraudulent misrepresentation to establish jurisdiction
Parental alienation 
Bad faith litigation
All therapy/counseling costs related to separation from Felix
Realized Damages Documentation (will be provided)
Lost wages from improper venue
Travel expenses
Legal costs
Lost business opportunities
Property access denial
Healthcare access denial
Interference with Parent-Child Relationship
Every denied visitation with monetary value
Impact on Felix's relationship with siblings
Loss of parental companionship
Educational decision-making interference
V. REQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER
Petitioner respectfully requests a fee waiver for the filing of this petition. Petitioner is currently experiencing financial hardship and lacks the resources to pay the filing fee. A fee waiver is necessary to ensure access to justice.
VI. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court grant the Writ of Mandamus and provide the relief requested.

** Name ** AFFIDAVIT OF MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON

AFFIDAVIT OF MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON
I, MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, being duly sworn, state as follows:
Introduction
I am the Respondent/Counter-Petitioner in the above-captioned matter.
Residency of Felix Salmon
Felix Salmon resided in Stone County, Missouri, for less than six months�from May 17, 2024, to November 13, 2024.
Lack of Significant Connection to Stone County
At the time this case was filed, neither parent had any significant connection to Stone County. Neither I nor Crycella Freitag have any meaningful ties to Stone County. We have no family, no friends, and no community connections in the area. The fact that our witnesses had to drive over four hours to attend court proceedings further demonstrates the lack of any substantial connection to the jurisdiction.
Deceptive Statements by Petitioner
The only reason Felix remained in Stone County beyond what was necessary was due to deceptive statements made by Petitioner/Counter-Respondent, Crycella Freitag.
Exhibit I: Text Messages
Attached as Exhibit I are text messages from Crycella Freitag, in which she:
Encouraged me to remain in Branson, despite having no intention of living with me.
Gave false assurances about our cohabitation, despite admitting in court that she had lost romantic interest and moved out permanently.
Deliberately attempted to influence my residency to create a false claim to Stone County as a proper venue.
These messages demonstrate that Petitioner/Counter-Respondent and her legal counsel manipulated the legal process in bad faith to establish an improper venue.
Current Residency and Jurisdiction
Both parties now reside in Kansas. Missouri no longer has a continuing jurisdictional basis under the UCCJEA. Even if Missouri originally had jurisdiction, Stone County was an improper venue due to fraud and misrepresentation.
Unfair Treatment by the Court
Throughout these proceedings, the court has treated me unfairly in the following ways:
Perjury by Petitioner: The court has ignored clear evidence of perjury by Crycella Freitag, and her witness Jozef Hanratty including her false statements about her intentions to cohabitate, housing instability, and her deliberate misrepresentation of facts to establish jurisdiction in Stone County.
Ignoring Motions: The judge has consistently ignored or denied all motions filed by me, including motions to dismiss for improper venue and motions to transfer jurisdiction to Kansas.
Arbitrary Civil Arguments: The judge has allowed arbitrary civil arguments that are irrelevant to the custody determination, including arguments about my residency and financial status, which have no bearing on the best interests of Felix.
Bias and Prejudice: The judge has demonstrated bias and prejudice by consistently ruling in favor of the Petitioner without proper consideration of the evidence or the law.
Failure to Address Fraud: The court has failed to address the fraud and misrepresentation committed by the Petitioner, which has resulted in an improper venue and a miscarriage of justice.
Denial of Visitation: The judge�s order granting me only two hours of visitation on Saturdays was already excessively restrictive and not in the best interests of Felix. However, Crycella Freitag has denied even this limited visitation, further alienating me from my child.
Isolation from Family and Friends: Crycella Freitag has also refused to allow my friends and family to see Felix, effectively isolating him from his extended support network. This is not only unfair to me but also detrimental to Felix�s well-being and emotional development.
Request for Relief
This Court must vacate all orders and transfer this matter to the appropriate Kansas court.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

** Date ** Feb 26, 2025
** Name ** MOTION TO OBJECT TO PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION BY RESPONDENT'S SELECTED PSYCHOLOGIST AND TO REASSERT OBJECTIONS TO PRIOR UNADDRESSED ISSUES

MOTION TO OBJECT TO PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION BY RESPONDENT'S SELECTED PSYCHOLOGIST AND TO REASSERT OBJECTIONS TO PRIOR UNADDRESSED ISSUES
COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to reject the
psychological evaluation to be conducted by Susan K Vandeusen, who has been selected by
Respondent, and to instead appoint a neutral, court-approved evaluator. Additionally, Petitioner
seeks to formally reassert prior objections which have been ignored in these proceedings. In
support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:

I. OBJECTION TO RESPONDENT'S SELECTED
PSYCHOLOGIST
1. The Evaluator Lacks Neutrality and Presents a Conflict of Interest
1. The appointed psychologist, Susan K Vandeusen, was personally selected by
Respondent, rather than being a neutral evaluator appointed by the Court.
2. It is in the best interest of the child, Felix Salmon, that any psychological evaluation be
conducted by a neutral, court-appointed forensic psychologist, rather than a
professional with a potential bias toward one parent.
3. Susan K Vandeusen has no verifiable history of conducting forensic custody
evaluations and lacks publicly available records or professional reviews, raising
concerns about their credibility.
1

2. The Appointment of a Neutral Evaluator Ensures Fairness
4. Petitioner respectfully requests that, should a psychological evaluation be deemed
necessary, the Court appoint a licensed, neutral forensic psychologist with a proven
record of unbiased custody evaluations.
5. A neutral evaluator ensures fairness and prevents undue influence from either party in the
custody proceedings.
3. Due Process and Fair Treatment
6. The appointment of a neutral forensic evaluator is consistent with the principles of due
process and fairness in family court proceedings.
7. The Court has a duty to ensure that both parties are treated equally in any
psychological evaluations that may impact custody determinations.

II. REASSERTION OF PRIOR OBJECTIONS
4. Unaddressed Objections Demonstrating Systemic Bias
8. Petitioner has previously filed motions and objections regarding:
? The unilateral acceptance of Respondent�s requests while Petitioner�s filings
are ignored.
? The failure to acknowledge Petitioner�s evidence regarding financial support,
Felix�s residency history, and the Respondent�s lack of financial contribution.
? The denial of Petitioner�s ability to conduct discovery, including the
opportunity to submit interrogatories and obtain key financial and medical
records.
? The failure to address the jurisdictional argument that Felix has resided in
Wyandotte County for the majority of his life, making this the proper venue.
? The lack of enforcement against Respondent�s repeated refusals to provide
financial support, while Petitioner has been solely responsible for childcare and
living expenses.
5. Pattern of Procedural Imbalance
9. The Court�s pattern of denying or ignoring Petitioner�s motions while granting
Respondent�s requests is creating an unfair procedural imbalance.
10. The failure to consider evidence, grant basic discovery rights, and apply equal
standards raises serious concerns about judicial impartiality.

2

III. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
1. Reject the evaluation by Susan K Vandeusen due to the potential conflict of interest.
2. Appoint a neutral, court-approved forensic psychologist to conduct any required
evaluations.
3. Address and rule on Petitioner�s prior objections, which have been repeatedly
ignored.
4. Ensure equal consideration of both parties' filings and motions.
5. Grant any further relief this Court deems just and proper.
