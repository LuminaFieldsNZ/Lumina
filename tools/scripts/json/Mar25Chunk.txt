** Name ** OBJECTION TO THE QUALIFIED PROTECTIVE ORDER

OBJECTION TO THE QUALIFIED PROTECTIVE ORDER
Counter-Petitioner respectfully objects to the Qualified Protective Order. While we acknowledge the importance of protecting sensitive psychological information, the proposed order risks overcomplicating the process and diverting focus from the best interests of the child.

As Patterson v. Chicago, 141 F.3d 831, 836 (7th Cir. 1998) emphasizes simplicity and fairness in court proceedings; we request that the Court deny the motion to the extent it creates unnecessary complexity. Delays and procedural burdens would only exacerbate the harm caused by the opposing party�s actions and undermine the integrity of these proceedings.
OFFER OF PROOF
1. Motion to Review Racial Bias
The Honorable Judge Matt Alan Selby, court clerks, Josh Garrett, and Crycella Freitag(and family) have demonstrated a pattern of unfair treatment and racial bias against the Counter-Petitioner Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).  Formal reports detailing these incidents have been filed and are on record with the court. Specifically:
The presiding judge has made rulings that demonstrate a clear bias against the Counter-Petitioner, ignoring or discounting (17) articles of submitted valid evidence and arguments presented by the Counter-Petitioner.
Court clerks have engaged in recorded discriminatory behavior as Jurisdictional Overreach & Procedural Violations to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 81.12.
The Court�s failure to review the evidence allowed perjury to persist on multiple occasions, even after the Counter-Petitioner submitted clear proof to all parties. This disregard for the truth has created a hostile environment and severely prejudiced Counter-Petitioner�s right to a fair hearing.
These actions violate Due Process Clause outlined in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 3.3 (Candor Toward the Tribunal) and Rule 8.4 (Misconduct) Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868 (2009).
Requested Relief:
The Court refers this matter to the appropriate state bar association for disciplinary review, given The Honorable Judge Matt Alan Selby, court clerks, Josh Garrett, and Crycella Freitag(and family) willful violations of legal and ethical standards.

** Name ** Motion for Sanctions Against Mr. Garrett and Crycella Freitag

2. Motion for Sanctions Against Mr. Garrett and Crycella Freitag
(Re-filing motion to preserve the issue for appeal) Counter-Petitioner respectfully objects to the Court�s ruling on temporary custody order. Mr. Garrett and Crycella Freitag have repeatedly engaged in bad faith litigation tactics, including perjury, obstruction of justice, and racial bias, despite being warned of the consequences. His actions have caused significant financial, emotional, and psychological harm to Counter-Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and have directly interfered with Micheal�s ability to maintain a relationship with his son, Felix. Specifically:
Perjury and False Testimony: Mr. Garrett called witnesses who knowingly committed perjury, including Crycella, who made false statements under oath (e.g., �Micheal is unstable,� �I�m scared of him,� �Micheal yells at the Judge�). These claims are contradicted by video evidence.
Obstruction of Justice: Mr. Garrett coached Crycella in emotional manipulation, as evidenced by his repeated statements such as, �Watch his reaction.� He knowingly allowed this abuse of process to continue for weeks.
Unfair Custody Arrangement: Mr. Garrett requested a biased and unfair custody arrangement that was not in the best interest of Felix and was based on false and inflammatory statements.
Weaponization of the Legal System: Crycella repeatedly made false allegations to law enforcement and the court, including claims that Micheal is �unsafe� or �needs mental help,� without providing any evidence.
Racial Bias: The court's conduct demonstrates a pattern of racial bias, as they consistently undermined the credibility and evidence presented by the Black parent, while giving undue weight to the claims of the white parties involved.
Case Law:
Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991): Courts have inherent authority to impose sanctions for bad-faith conduct, including abusive litigation tactics.
Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752 (1980): Courts can sanction attorneys and parties for misconduct that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.
Shepherd v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 62 F.3d 1469 (D.C. Cir. 1995): Sanctions are appropriate for deliberate deception or obstruction of justice.

Requested Relief:
Lost Work and Time: Award Counter-Petitioner $10,000 for lost work and time directly resulting from the biased and bad-faith litigation tactics employed by the opposing party.
Debt Owed:
Order the immediate payment of the full $90,000 debt owed to Counter-Petitioner, with complete financial transparency to ensure compliance.
Compensatory Sanctions Against Josh Garrett:
Impose sanctions on Josh Garrett in the amount of $60,000 to compensate Micheal Lawrence Salmon for the following:
Financial Losses: On January 30th, Micheal explicitly warned Mr. Garrett to cease his misconduct and review the evidence, citing $30,000 in damages at that time. Despite this warning, Mr. Garrett doubled down on his bad faith conduct by knowingly presenting false testimony, including the claim that Kelly Truelove verified Jozef Hanratty�s narrative, which is contradicted by the evidence.
Relationship Damages: Mr. Garrett�s actions have directly interfered with Micheal�s ability to maintain a relationship with his son, Felix, causing irreparable harm and to his family who are following this case.
Emotional Distress: Micheal has endured severe emotional and psychological harm as a result of Mr. Garrett�s misconduct, including the perpetuation of false claims and perjury.
The Court compels the disclosure of all communications between Mr. Garrett, Crycella Freitag, Amanda Freitag (and husband), Kelly Truelove, Stephanie Reed, Tyler Brown, Micheal�s family, and Jozef Hanratty regarding efforts to misrepresent evidence.
The Court considers the impact of Mr. Garrett�s fraudulent claims on prior rulings, including the temporary custody order, and takes corrective action to rectify any decisions influenced by falsified evidence and strike all false claims submitted as fact.

** Name ** Motion to Refer for Criminal Investigation

3. Motion to Refer for Criminal Investigation
Reason: (Re-filing motion to preserve the issue for appeal) The actions of Crycella Freitag and Mr. Garrett meet the legal definitions of neglect, abuse, and conspiracy, including:
Perjury: Crycella and Mr. Garrett knowingly presented false testimony to the court.
Obstruction of Justice: They withheld evidence (e.g., the beginning of audio recordings, Josh and Kelly�s conversation transcript, Crycella�s financials, and text transcripts with Jozef, Amanda, Stephanie, Josh, and Petitioner�s family), edited recordings, and refused to comply with court orders.
Abuse of Process: Crycella weaponized law enforcement and made false allegations to gain an unfair advantage in custody proceedings. She also ignored court orders and alienated Felix from a capable and loving parent.
Conspiracy: Mr. Garrett and Crycella conspired to manipulate the legal system, including coaching witnesses and submitting false evidence.
Case Law:
State v. Smith, 456 S.W.3d 849 (Mo. 2015): Courts have the authority to refer matters for criminal investigation when there is evidence of abuse, neglect, or conspiracy.
United States v. Condon, 132 F.3d 653 (11th Cir. 1998): Conspiracy to commit perjury or obstruct justice is a criminal offense that warrants investigation.

** Name ** Motion for Contempt

4. Motion for Contempt
Reason: (Re-filing motion to preserve the issue for appeal) The opposing party has failed to comply with court orders and obstructed justice. Crycella repeatedly violated custody and visitation orders, and Mr. Garrett facilitated this misconduct.
In re Marriage of Crow and Gilmore, 103 S.W.3d 778 (Mo. App. 2004): A parent who repeatedly violates custody or visitation orders can be held in contempt and may face penalties, including modification of custody arrangements.

** Date ** Mar 3, 2025
** Name ** Petition for Sole Custody

4. Petition for Sole Custody
(Re-filing motion to preserve the issue for appeal) Counter-Petitioner respectfully objects to all Crycella�s motions for custody. Crycella has consistently acted in bad faith, including committing perjury, violating court orders, and intentionally separating Counter-Petitioner from Felix. She has also abused the legal process by weaponizing law enforcement, and threatening to do it again. Her actions demonstrate a pattern of behavior that is harmful to Felix�s well-being and undermines Micheal�s ability to act as a responsible parent. The Counter-Petitioner has demonstrated fairness and good co-parenting techniques.
Missouri Revised Statutes � 452.375: Custody decisions must be based on the best interests of the child, including the willingness of each parent to facilitate a relationship between the child and the other parent.
Requested Relief:
Grant Counter-Petitioner (Micheal Salmon) sole legal and physical custody of Felix.
Order that any visitation granted to Crycella Freitag be supervised (to be decided by Micheal), due to her demonstrated inability to act in Felix�s best interests.
Visitation schedule: Micheal has recommended up to 10 hours monthly (tracked via google calendar which is 2 hours more than what the court gave Micheal).
Set child support obligations at $500 per month, based on Crycella's lack of financial contributions and Micheal�s sole financial responsibility for Felix�s care.


** Date ** Mar 3, 2025
** Name ** Motion to Compel Discovery for Financials

6. Motion to Compel Discovery for Financials
Crycella has continuously refused to provide financial disclosures despite multiple requests and legal obligations demonstrating bad faith. Coached by Mr. Garrett, Crycella has made false statements regarding her financial status, the sources of her income, and has deliberately denied Micheal access to crucial financial information necessary for this case.
Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure 61.01: Failure to comply with discovery obligations warrants court intervention, including motions to compel and sanctions.
Karrick v. Hannaman 168 U.S. 328 (1897): A partner who, within the term stipulated in the articles of partnership for its continuance, to account to the copartner for his share of the property and of the profits of the partnership, according to the partnership agreement.
Breach of Fiduciary Duty: Crycella has a fiduciary duty to disclose financials relevant to child support and business obligations. Breach of Contract: As a 51% owner of Brambletwist LLC, Crycella has failed to fulfill her contractual obligations to disclose financials related to business operations and revenue.
Requested Relief:
The Court orders Crycella to produce complete financial disclosures within seven (7) days, including but not limited to:
All bank account statements (personal and business) from the last three years.
Tax returns for the last three years. Pay stubs and proof of income from any source. Documentation of any assets, trusts, or financial accounts held in her name or jointly.
Any financial records from friends and family, including profit/loss statements, distributions, and expenses. Impose sanctions on Crycella for her failure to comply with discovery, including monetary fines to cover legal expenses and time lost incurred by Micheal due to her non-compliance and a default ruling on financial matters if she fails to comply within (7) days.

** Date ** Mar 3, 2025
** Name ** Motion for Judicial Oversight and Rule 51 Certification


7. Motion for Judicial Oversight and Rule 51 Certification
The presiding judge has ruled against Counter-Petitioner multiple times despite clear evidence of perjury, obstruction, and misconduct by opposing counsel and related parties. A pattern of rulings suggests a lack of impartiality, requiring judicial review to ensure that future decisions are based solely on facts and law. The court has previously ignored or dismissed substantial evidence that directly contradicts claims made by Crycella Freitag and her legal team. The judge has failed to enforce accountability against those who have lied under oath, creating a prejudicial environment against Counter-Petitioner. Furthermore, given the pattern of adverse rulings and the clear appearance of judicial bias, Counter-Petitioner respectfully requests certification under Rule 51 for an immediate interlocutory appeal on the question of judicial bias. Waiting for a final judgment would cause undue prejudice to Counter-Petitioner and Felix, as the ongoing bias undermines the integrity of these proceedings and jeopardizes Felix�s best interests.
Due Process Clause � U.S. Constitution (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments): Every litigant is entitled to an impartial tribunal.
Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868 (2009): When judicial bias is apparent or reasonably questioned, due process demands review.
Missouri Supreme Court Rule 2-2.11: Judges must recuse themselves when their impartiality can reasonably be questioned.
Requested Relief:
The Court implements additional oversight, such as requiring written justifications for any rulings contrary to presented evidence.
The Court ensures that all evidence submitted in previous motions is properly reviewed before any further rulings and mandates an independent review of this case by an oversight panel to determine if prior rulings were improperly influenced.
Certification for Interlocutory Appeal: The Court certifies the question of judicial bias for immediate interlocutory appeal under Rule 51, as the issue presents a substantial legal question and delaying review would cause irreparable harm to Counter-Petitioner and Felix.
Conclusion
Counter-Petitioner Micheal Lawrence Salmon respectfully moves for the Court to grant the above motions in their entirety, ensuring that Felix�s best interests are protected and that justice is served. The opposing party�s misconduct, including perjury, obstruction of justice, and abuse of process, warrants immediate and decisive action to safeguard Felix�s well-being and the integrity of these proceedings. Counter-Petitioner seeks a final resolution that fully and permanently dismisses all claims, motions, and allegations brought by Crycella Elizabeth Freitag, while granting all requested relief to Micheal Lawrence Salmon.

** Name ** EMERGENCY MOTION TO ENFORCE AND PROTECT PARENTAL COMMUNICATION RIGHTS AND REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE HEARING

EMERGENCY MOTION TO ENFORCE AND PROTECT PARENTAL COMMUNICATION RIGHTS AND REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE HEARING

COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and files this Emergency Motion to enforce and protect his rights as a father to communicate with and parent his child, Felix Salmon, without undue interference from the Respondent, Crycella Freitag. Petitioner further requests an immediate hearing due to the urgent nature of this matter. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:


INTRODUCTION AND EMERGENCY BASIS FOR HEARING
Petitioner is the father of Felix Salmon, and the current custody arrangement, as ordered by this Court, is being weaponized by Respondent to intentionally destroy Petitioner�s relationship with his son.
Respondent has repeatedly and willfully interfered with Petitioner�s court-ordered parenting time and communication with Felix, including but not limited to:
a. Hanging up on scheduled calls between Petitioner and Felix;
b. Interrupting conversations, talking over Petitioner, and making false claims about the appropriateness of discussions;
c. Setting financial barriers to prevent Petitioner from exercising his parenting time;
d. Submitting edited video evidence and committing perjury to mislead the Court.
Respondent�s actions are causing immediate and irreparable harm to Felix�s emotional well-being and his relationship with Petitioner. This behavior is intentional, malicious, and in direct violation of this Court�s orders and the best interests of the child.
Despite Petitioner�s repeated attempts to address these issues, the Court has failed to take meaningful action, allowing Respondent to continue her harmful behavior unchecked.
This matter constitutes an emergency as it involves the immediate welfare of a child and the ongoing violation of Petitioner�s parental rights.

II. RELIEF REQUESTED
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
Grant an Emergency Hearing to address this matter immediately due to the urgent nature of the harm being caused to Felix and Petitioner�s relationship.
Order Respondent to Cease All Interference with Petitioner�s court-ordered parenting time and communication with Felix, including:
a. Prohibiting Respondent from hanging up on calls or interrupting conversations;
b. Requiring Respondent to remain silent during Petitioner�s scheduled calls with Felix;
c. Removing financial barriers that prevent Petitioner from exercising his parenting time.
Address Respondent�s Misconduct by:
a. Investigating Respondent�s submission of edited video evidence and perjury;
b. Imposing sanctions or other appropriate remedies for Respondent�s willful violations of court orders.
Modify the Custody Arrangement to ensure that Felix�s best interests are protected and that Petitioner�s rights as a father are upheld.

III. NOTICE OF HEARING
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court schedule an Emergency Hearing at the earliest possible date. If the Court denies the request for an emergency hearing, Petitioner requests that this matter be heard on April 4, 2024, as a backup date.

IV. CONCLUSION
Petitioner is being systematically denied his right to parent his son, Felix, due to Respondent�s intentional and malicious actions. This Court�s intervention is urgently needed to protect Felix�s well-being and ensure that Petitioner�s parental rights are upheld.
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court grant the relief outlined above and take any additional actions necessary to address this emergency situation.

** Name ** Evidence of Intentional Interference with Parenting Time

Evidence of Intentional Interference with Parenting Time

Comes now, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this Motion to Reaffirm the Court�s Access to All Case Evidence and Witness Testimony. This motion serves as a formal reiteration of previously provided access to all case materials, including text messages, video evidence, witness statements, and a chronological timeline of events, which have been made available to the Court at the following link:

https://luminafieldsnz.github.io/Lumina/legal/index.html

Despite multiple prior submissions and an in-person walkthrough of this platform during the last court hearing, the Court has continued to disregard the evidence provided. The Petitioner has attempted to comply with the Court�s directives regarding witness testimony; however, due to the Court�s refusal to transfer this case to the appropriate jurisdiction, Petitioner�s witnesses remain unable to travel the 8-hour distance required to testify in person.
This motion serves as a direct response to the Court�s failure to acknowledge four previous requests for a jurisdictional transfer and its ongoing dismissal of available digital evidence that eliminates the necessity of in-person witness travel.

To review the evidence, navigate to the Crycella tab on the provided web platform. Click on the Open Folder button, then open the Videos folder. Within these recordings, the Court will observe direct proof that Petitioner is not even permitted to sing a nursery rhyme to his child without Crycella�s emotional instability leading to an abrupt disconnection, demonstrating a pattern of bad-faith parenting and obstruction of court-ordered parenting time.
Additionally, despite the Court�s directive to discuss financial barriers to the Layne Project with Mr. Garrett, Petitioner�s attempts at communication have been ignored entirely. Furthermore, when Petitioner sought clarification from Crycella, she explicitly stated her refusal to consider any alternative supervised visitation centers, despite multiple good-faith proposals. This demonstrates a deliberate effort to manufacture financial and logistical barriers to prevent Petitioner from exercising his parenting rights.
WHEREFORE, Petitioner moves this Court to:
Acknowledge the availability and accessibility of all evidence and witness statements at the provided webapp link.
Confirm on record whether the Court has reviewed the evidence or state explicitly its refusal to do so.
Clarify why digital evidence submitted in a structured, accessible manner is being ignored despite the Court�s previous instruction to provide witness testimony.
Reconsider its previous denials of jurisdictional transfer in light of the logistical and procedural barriers imposed on Petitioner.

Petitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.

MOTION TO OBJECT TO EXCLUSION FROM PRE-TRIAL MEETING AND REQUEST FOR REMEDY

COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Pro Se Movant, and respectfully states the following:
On February 28, 2025, a pre-trial meeting was conducted regarding the temporary custody order in the above-referenced case.
Movant arrived at the courthouse to attend the meeting but was denied entry by court security. The officer stated Movant was not permitted to attend because he is not an attorney.
As a pro se litigant, Movant has the same rights as an attorney to participate in all proceedings related to his case, including pre-trial meetings. Denying Movant access to this proceeding constitutes a violation of his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and creates an unfair advantage for opposing counsel.
Movant has previously raised concerns about being excluded from key proceedings, yet this conduct has continued without justification.

WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests the following relief:
	a. An explanation from the Court as to why Movant was denied access to the pre-trial meeting.
	b. A transcript or recording of the meeting to ensure transparency and fairness.
	c. An order invalidating any decisions made during the meeting due to the procedural misconduct of excluding Movant.
	d. If no valid justification is provided, Movant reserves the right to seek sanctions and further legal remedies.

** Name ** MOTION TO COMPEL TESTIMONY, HOLD RESPONDENT IN CONTEMPT, AND REQUEST REMEDIAL RELIEF

MOTION TO COMPEL TESTIMONY, HOLD RESPONDENT IN CONTEMPT, AND REQUEST REMEDIAL RELIEF

COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for an order:
Compelling Respondent, Crycella Freitag, to testify under oath regarding her claims of fear and her conduct in this matter;
Holding Respondent in contempt for willful misrepresentation, perjury, and parental interference; and
Granting remedial relief to restore Petitioner�s parental rights and address the harm caused by Respondent�s actions.
In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND
Respondent�s Claims of Fear Are Fabricated and Contradict Her Own Testimony
Respondent has repeatedly claimed she is �scared� of Petitioner to justify withholding the minor child, Felix, from him. However, in court proceedings, Respondent has never testified under oath that she is afraid of Petitioner or that he has done anything to warrant such fear.
This inconsistency demonstrates that Respondent�s claims are a deliberate fabrication designed to manipulate the Court and alienate Petitioner from his child.
Respondent�s Collusion with Third Parties to Fabricate an Unstable Living Situation
On December 4, 2024, Respondent conspired with Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove to fabricate an �unstable living situation� for Petitioner.
Jozef Hanratty, Petitioner�s former landlord, rescinded his position and directed Petitioner to Kelly Truelove, who then refused all communication.
Respondent facilitated this collusion by refusing to intervene, despite being fully aware of the circumstances.
This fabricated instability was used to secure a temporary custody order on January 28, 2025, which Respondent now leverages to deny Petitioner access to Felix.
Respondent�s False Accusations and Edited Video Evidence
Respondent originally submitted an edited 12 minute video to the Court, which she admitted was incomplete. The full video, which is over 40 minutes long, was intentionally reduced to then 30 minutes to remove exculpatory evidence and given to Micheal.
In the video, Petitioner explicitly states, �I see you recording, so let�s get this out of the way so we can have a relationship with our son.� He then lists hypothetical statements a �bad father� might make, which Respondent has since misrepresented as threats.
Respondent�s manipulation of evidence constitutes perjury and a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court.

II. RESPONDENT�S PATTERN OF MISCONDUCT
Respondent�s Lies Under Oath
Respondent has repeatedly lied under oath, including:
Claiming Petitioner �kicked her out� of the house, despite testifying in court that she left voluntarily each week.
Failing to disclose her collusion with Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove to fabricate Petitioner�s living situation.
Misrepresenting the contents of the video evidence submitted to the Court.
Claiming Petitioner�s housing is unstable, while being the culprit.
Respondent�s Willful Parental Interference
Respondent has consistently interfered with Petitioner�s relationship with Felix by:
Denying Petitioner access to the child without justification.
Refusing to comply with court-ordered visitation schedules.
Manipulating the child�s perception of Petitioner through false narratives.
Yelling, talking, and demonstrating unstable co-parenting skills in front of Felix during Petitioner's court appointed time forcing narrative.

III. REQUEST FOR RELIEF
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
Compel Respondent to Testify Under Oath
Require Respondent to testify regarding her claims of fear, her collusion with third parties, and her manipulation of evidence.
Hold Respondent in Contempt
Find Respondent in contempt for:
Perjury and willful misrepresentation to the Court.
Parental interference and violation of Petitioner�s custodial rights.
Manipulation of evidence to mislead the Court.
Grant Remedial Relief
Invalidate the temporary custody order obtained through fraudulent means.
Strike everything Crycella submitted from record.
Order supervised visitation to restore Petitioner�s relationship with Felix.
Require Crycella to undergo a psychological evaluation to assess her fitness as a custodial parent.
Have Crycella return all Micheal�s property - (PC)
Award Petitioner attorney�s fees and costs incurred due to Respondent�s misconduct of no less than $60,000 for all the work attributed in the courts bias.


Petitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.

** Name ** MOTION TO COMPEL CLERK'S COMPLIANCE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF SCHEDULING MISCONDUCT


MOTION TO COMPEL CLERK�S COMPLIANCE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF SCHEDULING MISCONDUCT

COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Pro Se, and moves this Court to review and compel the Stone County Circuit Clerk�s office to comply with its obligations under the Local Court Rules and the Missouri Sunshine Law. The Clerk�s refusal to schedule my emergency motion on the designated Motion Day and its misrepresentation of the hearing date constitute misconduct and obstruct my right to due process and timely relief.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Emergency Motion Filed on March 13, 2025:
On March 13, 2025, I filed an Emergency Motion to Enforce and Protect Parental Communication Rights (hereinafter �Emergency Motion�). This motion was filed in good faith to address urgent issues affecting my parental rights and the well-being of my child.
Proper Motion Day for Associate Division I:
Pursuant to Local Rule 2.3.2, Motion Days for Associate Division I (presided over by the Hon. Matt A. Selby) occur on the second Friday of each month. For March 2025, the designated Motion Day was March 14, 2025.
Clerk�s Refusal to Schedule Motion on March 14, 2025:
Despite filing my Emergency Motion one day before the designated Motion Day (March 13, 2025), the Clerk�s office refused to schedule the motion for March 14, 2025. When I called the Clerk�s office on March 14, 2025, I was informed that my motion was not scheduled for that day and was instead set for April 7, 2025.
Misrepresentation of Hearing Date:
The Clerk�s office provided no explanation for why my Emergency Motion was not scheduled on the proper Motion Day. Instead, they misrepresented the hearing date, claiming it was set for April 7, 2025, which is not a designated Motion Day for Associate Division I.
Violation of Local Rules and Due Process:
The Clerk�s actions violate Local Rule 2.3.2 and obstruct my right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. By delaying the hearing of my Emergency Motion, the Clerk�s office is causing irreparable harm to my parental rights and my child�s well-being.

II. LEGAL ARGUMENT
Clerk�s Failure to Follow Local Rules:
The Clerk�s refusal to schedule my Emergency Motion on the designated Motion Day (March 14, 2025) violates Local Rule 2.3.2, which explicitly states that Motion Days for Associate Division I occur on the second Friday of each month.
Misrepresentation of Hearing Date:
The Clerk�s office misrepresented the hearing date by claiming my motion was set for April 7, 2025, which is not a valid Motion Day for Associate Division I. This creates the appearance of bias and deliberate obstruction.
Violation of Due Process:
The Clerk�s actions obstruct my right to due process by delaying the hearing of my Emergency Motion. Emergency motions are intended to address urgent matters, and any delay undermines their purpose and causes irreparable harm.
Failure to Provide Public Records:
Despite my formal requests under the Missouri Sunshine Law (RSMo � 610.010, et seq.), the Clerk�s office has refused to provide a list of scheduled motion hearings and other public records. This lack of transparency further obstructs my ability to advocate for my rights.

III. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, I respectfully request that this Court:
Order the Clerk�s Office to immediately provide a list of all motion hearings scheduled from March 1, 2025, to April 7, 2025, including the case numbers, parties involved, and hearing types.
Compel the Clerk�s Office to provide a written explanation as to why my Emergency Motion was not scheduled on the designated Motion Day (March 14, 2025) and why it was instead set for April 7, 2025.
Review the Clerk�s scheduling actions for potential misconduct, including violations of Local Court Rules and the Missouri Sunshine Law.
Set my Emergency Motion for the earliest valid Motion Day in accordance with Local Rule 2.3.2.
Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.


Petitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.

** Name ** MOTION TO DISMISS BASED ON JUDICIAL AND PROCEDURAL MISCONDUCT

MOTION TO DISMISS BASED ON JUDICIAL AND PROCEDURAL MISCONDUCT

COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Pro Se, and moves this Court to dismiss all pending matters in this case due to the pervasive judicial and procedural misconduct that has obstructed my right to due process and a fair hearing. The actions of the Court, the Clerk�s office, and opposing counsel have created an environment of bias and unfairness that renders further proceedings in this case unjust and unconstitutional.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Judicial Misconduct:
The Court has consistently ignored or misrepresented my motions, evidence, and arguments, despite my compliance with all procedural rules and deadlines.
The Court has failed to address the Clerk�s misconduct, including the refusal to schedule my motions on designated Motion Days and the misrepresentation of hearing dates.
Clerk�s Misconduct:
The Clerk�s office has repeatedly obstructed my access to the court by:
Refusing to schedule my Emergency Motion on the proper Motion Day (March 14, 2025).
Misrepresenting the hearing date as April 7, 2025, which is not a valid Motion Day.
Failing to provide public records requested under the Missouri Sunshine Law.
Abusing Pro se Judge communications.
Obstructing the appeals process.
Opposing Counsel�s Misconduct:
Mr. Josh Garrett, counsel for the opposing party, has engaged in bad-faith tactics, including:
Ignoring my attempts to communicate and resolve issues related to financial barriers to custody.
Submitting edited video evidence and relying on false testimony to mislead the Court.
Facilitating perjury in the face of evidence, and conspiring to kidnap.
Coaching Crycella on emotional manipulation techniques
Systemic Bias and Unfair Treatment:
The cumulative effect of these actions demonstrates a pattern of bias and unfair treatment that has deprived me of my right to due process and a fair hearing.
The Court�s refusal to address these issues has created an appearance of impropriety and undermined public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system.

II. LEGAL ARGUMENT
Violation of Due Process:
The actions of the Court, the Clerk�s office, and opposing counsel have violated my right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.
By ignoring my motions, misrepresenting hearing dates, and failing to address misconduct, the Court has denied me the opportunity to present my case and obtain timely relief.
Judicial Misconduct:
The Court�s failure to address the Clerk�s misconduct and its refusal to schedule my motions on designated Motion Days constitute judicial misconduct under Missouri Supreme Court Rule 2.
The Court�s actions have created an appearance of bias and unfairness that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.
Clerk�s Misconduct:
The Clerk�s refusal to follow Local Court Rules and provide public records violates RSMo � 610.010, et seq. (Missouri Sunshine Law) and obstructs my right to access the court.
Opposing Counsel�s Bad-Faith Tactics:
Mr. Garrett�s actions, including the submission of edited video evidence and reliance on false testimony, constitute bad-faith litigation tactics that have prejudiced my case and misled the Court.
Irreparable Harm:
The cumulative effect of these actions has caused irreparable harm to my parental rights and my child�s well-being. Further proceedings in this case would only compound this harm and perpetuate the unfair treatment I have experienced.

III. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, I respectfully request that this Court:
Dismiss all pending matters in this case due to the pervasive judicial and procedural misconduct that has obstructed my right to due process and a fair hearing.
Issue a written order detailing the Court�s findings regarding the misconduct of the Clerk�s office, opposing counsel, and the Court itself.
Refer this matter to the Missouri Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline of Judges for further investigation into the judicial misconduct that has occurred in this case.
Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.


Petitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.

MOTION FOR ISSUANCE OF SUBPOENA
COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court to issue a subpoena to compel the Layne Project to produce documents and testimony relevant to the above-captioned case. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:
The Layne Project has engaged in communications and financial arrangements directly impacting the outcome of court-ordered visitation.
On 02/19/2025, Emily of the Layne Project informed Petitioner via text message that if he could not pay for supervised visitation, they would seek payment from Respondent, and if she refused, they would notify the Court. Despite these assurances, the Layne Project has failed to notify the Court while continuing discussions with Respondent.
The requested subpoena seeks the production of:
a. All communications (including but not limited to emails, text messages, letters, and notes) between the Layne Project, Micheal Salmon, Crycella Freitag, Joshua Garrett, Natalie Kluttz, Carolyn Salmon, Chanille Witham, and any court personnel regarding this case.
b. All records of payments, invoices, or financial agreements related to this case, including any communications regarding payment disputes.
c. Any internal policies or procedures related to notifying the Court of payment disputes or non-compliance with financial obligations.
d. All records of communications between the Layne Project and the Court regarding this matter.
Additionally, Petitioner seeks to depose representatives of the Layne Project regarding their involvement in the facilitation or obstruction of visitation.
This information is crucial to determining the extent to which the Layne Project has intervened in the visitation process in a manner inconsistent with their stated obligations and the best interests of the minor child.
Petitioner has reason to believe that Respondent and third parties may be using the Layne Project�s inaction to interfere with visitation rights.
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court issue a subpoena compelling the Layne Project to produce the requested documents and to appear for deposition at a date and time to be determined by the Court.
MOTION TO INCLUDE LAYNE PROJECT INTERVENTION IN CASE RECORD
COMES NOW, the Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to formally recognize the Layne Project's interference in this case and compel appropriate corrective action. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:
The Layne Project was assigned to facilitate supervised visitation and communication between the parties.
Petitioner was informed by Emily, an employee of the Layne Project, via text message that due to financial constraints, the Layne Project would seek payment from the Respondent and, if she refused, they would notify the Court.
Petitioner proactively informed the Layne Project to proceed accordingly and has remained transparent in all communications regarding the matter.
The owner of the Layne Project, Trina Nudson, who is also an attorney, confirmed this procedural step to Petitioner.
Despite these assurances, the Layne Project has failed to contact the Court as promised and instead has continued to engage with Respondent, who insists on enforcing the payment requirement while knowing Petitioner cannot comply.
This inaction has directly affected Petitioner's ability to engage in court-ordered visitations, thereby interfering with due process and access to parental rights.
Such failure to act as stated constitutes a material obstruction of justice, warranting judicial intervention.
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
Order the Layne Project to submit a written explanation of their actions and why they have not contacted the Court as stated.
Include the Layne Project�s conduct as a relevant factor in the proceedings.
Issue any further relief deemed necessary and just under the circumstances.

Petitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.

** Name ** MOTION TO SCHEDULE REMOTE DEPOSITIONS VIA WEBEX

MOTION TO SCHEDULE REMOTE DEPOSITIONS VIA WEBEX

COMES NOW, the Petitioner, Micheal Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for an order permitting the depositions of the following 20 witnesses to be conducted remotely via Webex, a secure video conferencing platform. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:
Background:
Petitioner has identified 20 witnesses whose testimony is critical to the resolution of this case.
These witnesses are located in various geographic locations, making in-person depositions impractical and cost-prohibitive.
Good Cause for Remote Depositions:
Travel costs for in-person depositions would impose an undue financial burden on the parties.
Remote depositions via Webex will allow all parties to participate efficiently and without unnecessary delay.
Webex is a secure, reliable platform that allows for real-time video and audio communication, ensuring the integrity of the deposition process.
Proposed Schedule:
Petitioner proposes that the depositions be scheduled over a period of [7 days], with each deposition lasting no more than [ 20 minutes ].
Petitioner will coordinate with all parties and witnesses to identify mutually agreeable dates and times.
Compliance with Court Rules:
Remote depositions via Webex comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(4), which permit depositions to be taken by remote means.
All parties will have the opportunity to examine the witnesses, and a certified court reporter will be present to administer oaths and transcribe the proceedings.
Relief Requested:
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court enter an order:
A. Permitting the depositions of the 20 witnesses to be conducted remotely via Webex.
B. Establishing a deadline for the completion of all depositions.
C. Requiring all parties to cooperate in scheduling the depositions at mutually convenient times.
D. Granting any further relief the Court deems just and proper.


WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court grant this Motion and issue an order permitting remote depositions via Webex for the 20 witnesses identified in this case.

Petitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.

** Name ** OBJECTION TO PETITIONER'S ATTORNEY'S REQUEST FOR PHONE APPEARANCE AND REQUEST TO RESCHEDULE HEARING FOR IN-PERSON TESTIMONY

OBJECTION TO PETITIONER'S ATTORNEY'S REQUEST FOR PHONE APPEARANCE AND REQUEST TO RESCHEDULE HEARING FOR IN-PERSON TESTIMONY
COMES NOW, Respondent, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and objects to Attorney Joshua L. Garrett�s request to appear via telephone for the hearing on March 26, 2025. In support of this objection, Respondent states as follows:
Attorney Garrett�s Presence is Necessary � This hearing concerns Petitioner�s Motion for Attorney�s Fees, a matter in which Attorney Garrett has a direct financial interest and a conflict of interest due to his involvement with The Lane Project. His personal presence is necessary to allow the Court to properly evaluate his claims and permit cross-examination regarding his conduct in this case.


Attorney Garrett�s Misconduct and the Need for Accountability � Throughout this litigation, Attorney Garrett has:


Repeatedly misrepresented facts before the Court.
Ignored the Court�s direct order to facilitate a resolution where Respondent could have access to his son.
Refused all communication from Respondent, effectively aiding Petitioner in creating a financial and procedural barrier to visitation.
Intentionally prolonged litigation, inflating fees while obstructing due process.
His in-person testimony is critical to ensuring transparency and preventing any undue influence or misrepresentation through a remote appearance.


Attorney Garrett Must Be Questioned Regarding His Connection to The Lane Project � Respondent has reason to believe that Attorney Garrett has conflicts of interest and external affiliations that compromise his role as an objective legal representative. His in-person testimony is necessary to address these potential conflicts and ensure they are fully examined before the Court.


Phone Testimony Would Prejudice Respondent � Given the complexity and the contested nature of this case, allowing Attorney Garrett to appear remotely would:


Deny Respondent the ability to challenge his role in obstructing the Court�s orders.
Prevent full examination of his financial interests in prolonging litigation.
Allow Garrett to evade accountability for his misconduct and procedural violations.
An in-person appearance ensures that Respondent may effectively challenge his assertions and hold him accountable for his conduct.


Request for an Earlier Hearing Date � To prevent scheduling conflicts from obstructing this matter, Respondent respectfully requests that the hearing be rescheduled for an earlier date to ensure Attorney Garrett�s physical attendance. Given the Court�s decision to expedite Petitioner�s attorney fee hearing while delaying Respondent�s emergency motions, this request is necessary to ensure fairness in scheduling.


RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that this Court:
Deny Attorney Garrett�s request for a telephonic appearance and require his in-person attendance.
Compel Garrett to answer under oath regarding his relationship with The Lane Project and his role in obstructing the Court�s orders.
Reschedule the hearing to an earlier date to prevent further procedural gamesmanship.
Grant any other relief this Court deems just and proper.
Petitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.

** Name ** RESPONDENT'S RESPONSE AND CORRECTION TO PETITIONER'S OBJECTIONS TO LIST OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATORS


RESPONDENT'S RESPONSE AND CORRECTION TO PETITIONER�S OBJECTIONS TO LIST OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATORS
COMES NOW, Respondent, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and submits this response to correct the false and misleading assertions made in Petitioner�s Objections to Respondent�s Provided List of Psychological Evaluators, stating as follows:
Petitioner�s Counsel's Allegations Are Unfounded � The claim that Respondent submitted a "ChatGPT authored list" without research is both incorrect and defamatory. The evaluators Respondent has now provided are fully licensed and verified professionals in Kansas City, Missouri.


Verified Qualified Evaluators � Respondent now submits two verified professionals with the credentials and experience necessary for psychological evaluations relevant to this case:


Caleb M. Stephens, LMSW, LCSW � A licensed therapist based in Kansas City with extensive experience in trauma, family therapy, and psychological evaluations. Website: https://drcalebstephens.com.
Liz Davis, LPC � A licensed professional counselor in Kansas City with expertise in psychological assessments and therapy. Website: https://www.lizdavistherapy.com.
Complete List of Available Evaluators � In addition to the above, a comprehensive list of licensed African-American therapists and evaluators in the Kansas City area is publicly available at: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/ks/kansas-city?category=african-american.


Petitioner�s Counsel�s Attempt to Mislead the Court � Counsel�s claims regarding Respondent�s previous submission were made in bad faith and without conducting any due diligence to verify the accuracy of the listed providers. Respondent�s efforts to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation should not be met with baseless attacks but with cooperation in securing a qualified professional.


WHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that this Court:
Strike Petitioner�s Objections as factually inaccurate and misleading.
Accept the updated and verified list of evaluators.
Hold Petitioner and her Counsel accountable for misrepresentations to the Court regarding Respondent�s submissions.
Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.
Petitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.

** Name ** MOTION FOR CONTEMPT AGAINST ATTORNEY JOSH GARRETT


MOTION FOR CONTEMPT AGAINST ATTORNEY JOSH GARRETT
COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to find Attorney Josh Garrett in contempt for failure to comply with the Court�s explicit instructions regarding facilitation of parenting time. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:
1. Background
The Court previously ordered that Attorney Josh Garrett work with Respondent, Crycella Freitag, to facilitate Petitioner�s court-ordered parenting time.
This ruling was made in recognition of the importance of maintaining a parent-child relationship and ensuring Petitioner�s legally recognized rights were not obstructed.
2. Noncompliance and Willful Defiance
Despite this order, Attorney Josh Garrett has explicitly refused to comply. Instead, he has:
 a. Failed to communicate with Petitioner regarding parenting time arrangements.
 b. Advised the Court that he does not have to speak to Petitioner, directly contradicting the Court�s instructions.
 c. Acted in bad faith by obstructing Petitioner�s rightful access to his child.
3. Violation of Court Orders and Contempt
Attorney Josh Garrett�s actions constitute willful disobedience of a court order, justifying a finding of contempt under Missouri law.
His refusal to comply with the Court�s directive has directly harmed Petitioner�s ability to maintain his parental relationship.
4. Relief Sought
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
Hold Attorney Josh Garrett in contempt for failing to comply with the Court�s instructions.
Impose appropriate sanctions to remedy the harm caused by his misconduct.
Compel Attorney Josh Garrett to comply with the Court�s order and facilitate parenting time as previously instructed.
Grant any further relief the Court deems just and proper.
Petitioner submits this motion in good faith to ensure that all evidence is given proper consideration and to prevent continued procedural obfuscation that inhibits due process.

** Name ** MOTION TO CLARIFY JUDICIAL RULINGS AND PROVIDE BASIS FOR DENIED MOTIONS

MOTION TO CLARIFY JUDICIAL RULINGS AND PROVIDE BASIS FOR DENIED MOTIONS

COMES NOW, Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court to provide clarification on its rulings regarding the denial and dismissal of Movant�s motions, and in support states as follows:

1. Lack of Judicial Response to Petitioner�s Motions

Movant has filed multiple motions, which have been denied or dismissed without written explanation or justification from the Court. Movant has made repeated requests for clarification as to the reasoning behind these decisions, yet no response has been provided.

2. Impact on Trial Preparation

The Court�s refusal to provide reasoning for its rulings has severely hindered Movant�s ability to prepare for the upcoming hearing on March 26th, and April 7, 2025. Without clarification, Movant is left unable to determine what legal arguments, evidence, or procedural adjustments are necessary for trial.

3. Disparate Treatment of Correspondence

While Movant�s formal letter seeking judicial clarification has gone unanswered, the Court has responded to written communications in the same time frame from opposing counsel, creating a perception of bias.

4. Request for Relief

Movant respectfully requests that this Court:
Provide a written explanation for the denial/dismissal of all relevant motions.
Clarify which legal issues and evidence will be permitted or excluded in the upcoming hearing.
Issue any necessary orders to ensure both parties receive equal consideration in pre-trial proceedings.
Procedural History and Court�s Lack of Correction
Throughout these proceedings, I have submitted numerous motions, filings, and legal arguments. At no point has the Court provided any notice of procedural deficiencies, errors, or the need for corrections in any of my submissions. The Court has also not issued any rulings indicating that I have failed to meet procedural requirements or comply with court rules. Given this, any attempt to disregard or summarily deny my filings without explanation would indicate an arbitrary and capricious refusal to consider properly submitted legal arguments.
WHEREFORE, Movant requests that this Court issue an order clarifying its rulings and providing the necessary information to ensure a fair and just proceeding.



** Date ** Mar 25, 2025
** Name ** Letter to Judge Selby

Dear Judge Selby,

Pursuant to the Court�s notice of hearing for March 26th, 2025 at 10:30 a.m - 
I am writing to formally address the ongoing violations of my rights and the court�s repeated failure to apply legal standards fairly in my custody case. This letter serves as an official request for written clarification on multiple legal errors and procedural violations that have obstructed my ability to seek justice. As established in State ex rel. Houska v. Dickhaner, 323 S.W.3d 29 (Mo. 2010), mandamus is appropriate when a court fails to perform duties required by law or abuses its discretion in ways that cannot be adequately remedied through ordinary appeals. The pattern of procedural violations in this case meets this standard.
1. The Unlawful Basis for the Temporary Custody Order
Missouri law is clear on the requirements for granting a temporary custody order: Imminent Danger Standard (RSMo 210.125): Emergency custody can only be granted if there is reasonable cause to believe a child is in immediate danger due to abuse or neglect. Temporary Custody Orders (RSMo 452.380): Courts must rely on clear, supporting evidence demonstrating that a change in custody is in the child�s best interest.
The sole justification for granting the temporary custody motion was the false testimony of Jozef Hanratty, who falsely claimed I was facing eviction. The court itself acknowledged that if I remained in my residence the following week, it would prove Jozef�s dishonesty.
One week later, I was still in my residence, confirming the perjury committed by Hanratty. Despite this, my motion to dismiss was ignored. Furthermore, I have since submitted multiple documents proving Jozef and Crycella�s dishonesty, including:
A letter from Kelly Truelove�s attorney validating my lawful tenancy.
Video evidence of Crycella denying my court-ordered communication with Felix.
Formal legal documents disproving the eviction claim.
Yet, the court has refused to review this clear and irrefutable evidence, allowing an unlawful ruling to stand in direct violation of due process. Mr. Garrett has facilitated this unlawful and in bad faith conspiracy to purge me of my residence.
The Missouri Supreme Court in In re Marriage of Hendrix, 183 S.W.3d 582 (Mo. 2006), established that modifications to custody must be supported by substantial evidence demonstrating that a change would serve the child's best interests. The court's continued reliance on Mr. Hanratty's demonstrably false testimony violates this standard. Furthermore, in Murphy v. Carron, 536 S.W.2d 30 (Mo. 1976), the court established that judicial decisions must be supported by substantial evidence and cannot be against the weight of the evidence. The refusal to consider my documentary proof directly contradicts this foundational principle of Missouri law.
2. Due Process Violations and the Court�s Pattern of Dismissal
For nearly two months, I have submitted repeated requests for enforcement of court orders, sanctions for perjury, and responses to procedural violations. Instead of legal resolution, I have been met with deliberate inaction, refusal to acknowledge evidence, and arbitrary denials of my motions. The following concerns require immediate explanation:
Why has the court repeatedly refused to review my submitted evidence?
Why have I been denied an opportunity to properly present my case, with time limits imposed despite the complexity and volume of the evidence?
Why has the court failed to enforce its own orders when Crycella continues to violate custody agreements and deny communication?
What standard of proof is this court applying, and why is it selectively disregarding evidence that disproves the opposing party�s claims?
The refusal to provide transparency on these legal issues does not just harm me�it sets a precedent that erodes public trust in the judicial system. The United States Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), recognized that parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their children. This court's repeated refusal to review submitted evidence and provide a fair hearing violates this constitutionally protected right. As established in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), procedural due process requires balancing the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation through current procedures, and the government's interest. The current proceedings fail this constitutional test by systematically denying my opportunity to present evidence that directly refutes the claims upon which the temporary order was based.
3. The Court�s Direct Role in Facilitating the Destruction of Parental Rights
The law recognizes that continued separation from a parent is inherently damaging to a child. If the court is genuinely operating in Felix�s best interest, it must answer the following:
How does prolonged separation from a fit and loving parent benefit Felix�s well-being?
What specific needs was Felix not receiving while in my care?
Why has the court refused to provide a formal reason for my denied custody and visitation rights?
Your refusal to address these questions has directly enabled the obstruction of my parental rights, and the damage inflicted upon my relationship with Felix may soon become irreparable. In Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972), the Supreme Court held that parents are entitled to a hearing on their fitness before their children can be removed from their custody. This court has effectively bypassed this requirement by maintaining separation without proper evidentiary basis. The Missouri Court of Appeals in Searcy v. Searcy, 38 S.W.3d 462 (Mo. App. 2001), emphasized that the best interest of the child standard requires consideration of the child's need for meaningful contact with both parents. The prolonged and unjustified separation from Felix directly contradicts this established legal principle.
4. Judicial Negligence Has Resulted in a Legal Imbalance
Your Honor, in a courtroom, both parties must be held to the same standard. Yet, Mr. Garrett and Crycella have been permitted to:
Commit perjury without consequence.
Ignore court orders without penalty.
Refuse transparency while I am forced to provide full financial disclosure.
Withhold communications and legal documentation necessary for my case.
Meanwhile, I have faced relentless obstruction in my efforts to simply ensure fairness.
5. The Court�s Failure to Address These Issues Will Be Part of the Official Record
As established in Nazeri v. Missouri Valley College, 860 S.W.2d 303 (Mo. 1993), courts have an obligation to consider evidence properly submitted. The systematic dismissal of my evidence without explanation violates this fundamental judicial responsibility. For the purposes of creating a clear record for appeal under the standards set forth in Murphy v. Carron, I request specific findings regarding what evidence the court has considered and the legal basis for dismissing verified documentation that directly contradicts opposing counsel's claims.
To ensure clarity and for the purposes of an appeal, I request that the following be addressed:
What specific evidence does this court consider insufficient, and by what legal standard is it being dismissed?
Has the court reviewed the video evidence of Crycella violating my custody rights?
What authority does Mr. Garrett have in determining custody arrangements, and why has he been given the authority to refuse communication between me and my son?
Why has the court failed to enforce its own orders while simultaneously penalizing me for procedural actions that I have lawfully followed?
What additional evidence does the court require to correct its clear bias?
6. This Court Must Take Responsibility for the Harm It Has Caused
The failure to fairly enforce the law has emboldened Crycella to continue violating my rights without fear of consequence. This is not just a failure of one case�it is an institutional failure that undermines the very function of the judicial system. This court�s failure to enforce the law fairly has created an environment where Crycella feels emboldened to violate my rights with impunity, effectively destroying any chance at a meaningful parent-child relationship. Your Honor, awarding fees to Crycella and Mr. Garrett in this case would set a dangerous precedent�one where pro se litigants who uncover procedural errors are penalized financially while attorneys who fail to address these errors get rewarded. The work I have done vastly exceeds Mr. Garrett�s, and it was necessitated by his and the court�s own failures. 
I demand a formal, on-the-record response to these issues before my upcoming hearing and request that this letter be entered into the official record of these proceedings.

St. Louis, Missouri 63131
Fax: (314) 966-0076
Email: jim.smith@courts.mo.gov
Dear Members of the Commission,
I am submitting this formal complaint against Judge Matt Alan Selby, presiding in Stone County Missouri, for violations of judicial conduct that have resulted in a denial of due process and have significantly undermined the integrity of the judiciary. The actions of Judge Matt Alan Selby demonstrate a willful and persistent failure to perform duties, a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and conduct that brings the judiciary into disrepute.
Case No. 24SN-DR00104
Allegations of Judicial Misconduct:
Willful Failure to Perform Duties & Due Process Violations
Judge Matt Alan Selby has systematically ignored and refused to rule on numerous motions that were properly filed and served.
This refusal to address critical legal matters has directly prejudiced my case and deprived me of my constitutional right to a fair hearing.
Bias and Unequal Treatment of Litigants
The judge has demonstrated a pattern of favoring the opposing party, including responding to their informal communications while refusing to address my formal filings.
In one instance, the judge ignored my submitted physical evidence, refused to accept it, then ruled in the opposing counsel's favor because he had to pick his kids up from school.
Failure to Adhere to Court Procedures & Judicial Ethics
The judge has acted in contravention of judicial standards by failing to issue written orders on key matters, making it impossible to properly appeal rulings.
The judge has permitted opposing counsel to violate procedural rules without consequence while holding me, as a pro se litigant, to a different standard.
Conduct Bringing the Judiciary into Disrepute
The judge�s refusal to rule on properly submitted filings, coupled with apparent bias, has created the appearance of impropriety and diminished public confidence in the court�s ability to function impartially.
Requested Action:
Given the severity of these violations, I respectfully request the Commission conduct a full investigation intoJudge Matt Alan Selby�s misconduct. I urge the Commission to consider formal disciplinary action, including reprimand, suspension, or referral to the Missouri Supreme Court for removal, if appropriate.
I have attached supporting documents, including copies of my motions, court transcripts, and any relevant communications, to substantiate my claims. I am available to provide further information or testimony as needed.
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

** Name ** MOTION TO ADDRESS JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT, DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS, AND FAILURE TO ENFORCE VISITATION RIGHTS


MOTION TO ADDRESS JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT, DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS, AND FAILURE TO ENFORCE VISITATION RIGHTS
COMES NOW, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, Movant, and respectfully moves this Court to address multiple procedural and substantive violations occurring during the 3/27/2025 Webex hearing, including judicial misconduct, denial of due process, and failure to enforce visitation rights. In support thereof, Movant states as follows:
1. Judicial Misconduct and Bias
The Court repeatedly misrepresented Movant�s statements on record, requiring Movant to repeat himself multiple times while the judge feigned confusion.
The Court�s behavior resulted in material distortion of the record, which may severely impact appellate review and deprives Movant of a fair hearing.
The Court manipulated the proceedings to align with a predetermined outcome, ignoring relevant facts and legal arguments presented by Movant.
The court refused three occasions of preliminary questions that would assist Movant.
2. Denial of Due Process
The Webex hearing was improperly terminated, preventing Movant from asking critical questions and further clarifying mischaracterized statements.
The Court disregarded prior motions and filings, forcing Movant to resubmit information that had already been placed on record, thereby delaying resolution and causing undue burden.
The Court allowed opposing counsel, Josh Garrett, to unilaterally dictate supervision terms without review or proper legal authority.
3. Failure to Enforce Custody and Visitation Rights
Movant has been wrongfully denied visitation with his child, Felix, for over two months, in direct violation of prior orders and Missouri custody laws.
The Court failed to take action despite acknowledging that Respondent, Crycella Freitag, was in violation of previous orders.
The Court�s inaction effectively condones Respondent�s noncompliance, further alienating Movant from his child and undermining the best interests of the minor.
4. Misconduct by Opposing Counsel
Opposing counsel, Josh Garrett, falsely framed a prior phone call to paint Movant in a negative light, attempting to distort the record.
The Court, while acknowledging a "grey area," nonetheless failed to hold Respondent accountable for her refusal to comply with court-ordered visitation.
Opposing counsel has continuously acted in bad faith by obstructing Movant�s parental rights, yet the Court continues to allow his undue influence over supervision arrangements.
RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:
Correct the official court record to reflect Movant�s actual statements, as opposed to the judge�s mischaracterizations.
Provide Movant with an opportunity to clarify any outstanding issues unfairly cut off during the Webex hearing.
Immediately enforce prior visitation orders and sanction Respondent for willful noncompliance.
Remove opposing counsel�s undue influence over supervision arrangements and assign an impartial third party.
Issue any further relief deemed just and proper in the interest of fairness and due process.
PETITIONER�S MOTION FOR HEARING AND REVIEW
COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, pro se, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court set a hearing and conduct a review on March 31, 2025, to address the numerous accusations and questions that the Court has refused to acknowledge throughout these proceedings. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:
Petitioner has submitted multiple motions highlighting critical procedural failures, judicial bias concerns, and violations of due process that have yet to be properly acknowledged or adjudicated.
The Court has failed to respond to or act upon key motions and court orders, creating an unfair and prejudicial environment against Petitioner.
The Court has provided responses to the opposing counsel�s submissions while refusing to address direct communications and concerns raised by Petitioner, further demonstrating bias and procedural misconduct.
Petitioner asserts that the failure to address these issues has resulted in continued harm and an obstruction of justice, warranting immediate review and resolution.
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Schedule a hearing on March 31, 2025, to review all unacknowledged accusations and procedural concerns raised by Petitioner; B. Address and provide rulings on all outstanding motions previously submitted by Petitioner; C. Ensure a fair and unbiased review of all concerns that have been improperly dismissed or ignored; D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

** Name ** MOTION TO COMPEL FREITAG TO COMPLY WITH FEBRUARY 25 ORDER & STRIKE FALSE NOTICE


MOTION TO COMPEL FREITAG TO COMPLY WITH FEBRUARY 25 ORDER & STRIKE FALSE NOTICE
NOW COMES Movant, Micheal Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to:
Compel Counter-Respondent Freitag to immediately schedule and pay for Movant�s psychological evaluation as ordered by this Court on February 25, 2025.


Strike the fraudulent statement in the March 26 Notice of Entry, which incorrectly claims that Movant was ordered to "file" a psychological evaluation.


Sanction Counter-Respondent Freitag and Attorney Garrett for their noncompliance with the Court�s February 25 order and their misrepresentation to the Court.


GROUNDS FOR RELIEF
The February 25, 2025 Order Clearly Required Counter-Respondent Freitag to Arrange and Pay for the Psychological Evaluation.

 The Court�s original order (Exhibit A) specifically states:
 "Counter-Respondent (Freitag) shall arrange and pay for Movant�s psychological evaluation."
 Despite this explicit directive, Counter-Respondent Freitag has failed to comply for over 30 days. Nevertheless, the March 26 Notice of Entry falsely states that Movant was ordered to obtain the evaluation, thus inaccurately portraying Movant as noncompliant.


Judicial Fraud on the Record.

 The March 26 Notice claims:
 "Movant was ordered to obtain a psychological examination on February 25, 2025."
 This statement is demonstrably false. As the attached order (Exhibit A) clearly indicates, the responsibility to arrange and pay for the evaluation was placed on Counter-Respondent Freitag, not Movant. This misrepresentation has prejudiced Movant by casting a false light on his compliance with court orders.


Delegation of Judicial Responsibilities to Opposing Counsel.

 In a recent phone call with the Clerk�s Office (Exhibit C), the Clerk confirmed:
 "The judge said you need to contact Mr. Garrett for next steps."
 This is a violation of Missouri Code of Judicial Conduct 2.2, which prohibits judges from delegating their judicial responsibilities to opposing counsel. Mr. Garrett has no legal authority to dictate the Court�s orders. This conduct undermines the integrity of these proceedings and violates Movant�s rights to a fair and impartial process.


RELIEF REQUESTED
Movant respectfully requests that the Court:
Order Counter-Respondent Freitag to schedule and pay for the psychological evaluation within 48 hours of this motion�s filing or hold Counter-Respondent Freitag in contempt of court for failing to comply with the February 25, 2025 order.


Strike the false statement in the March 26 Notice of Entry which claims that Movant was ordered to obtain the psychological evaluation, correcting the record to reflect the true terms of the February 25 order.


Sanction Counter-Respondent Freitag and Attorney Garrett for their continued noncompliance and misrepresentation of the Court�s orders, as outlined above.


Clarify that the judge�not opposing counsel�must rule on motions and make determinations regarding procedural matters.


PROOF OF FRAUD (FILED EXHIBITS)
Exhibit A: February 25, 2025 Order, showing Counter-Respondent Freitag�s obligation to arrange and pay for the evaluation.


Exhibit B: March 26, 2025 Notice of Entry, highlighting the fraudulent statement regarding the responsibility for the psychological evaluation.


Exhibit C: Call log/recording from Clerk�s Office, confirming the judge�s improper delegation of responsibilities to opposing counsel.


FINAL WARNING TO THE COURT
As the Missouri Court of Appeals is currently reviewing this case:
Court of Appeals Case No. SD38905
Movant formally requests the Court take immediate action to correct these issues. If the Court fails to address these concerns promptly:
Movant will file a judicial misconduct complaint against the judge and counsel involved in this matter.


Movant will seek federal intervention under 42 U.S.C. � 1983 for violations of constitutional rights, including due process and equal protection.

MOTION FOR SOLE CUSTODY, CHILD SUPPORT, AND LEGAL FEES
NOW COMES Movant, Micheal Salmon, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court for an immediate ruling on all pending motions, an award of sole legal and physical custody, child support, and legal fees, based on the following:
I. MOTION FOR PROMPT RULING ON PENDING MOTIONS
Movant has filed multiple motions essential to the fair adjudication of this case, yet they remain unresolved despite proper service and presentation to the Court.
The lack of rulings has caused significant prejudice to Movant, including but not limited to:
Hindrance of Movant�s ability to exercise court-ordered parenting time.
Procedural confusion due to the Court�s failure to enforce compliance.
Lack of legal clarity, creating an unfair advantage for Respondent.
Failure to rule on these motions constitutes judicial inaction, violating Movant�s due process rights and judicial efficiency principles.
Movant requests an immediate ruling on all pending motions, including a written explanation for any motion the Court declines to rule on.
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:
Issue rulings on all outstanding motions without further delay;
Provide a written explanation for any motion the Court declines to rule on; and
Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.
II. MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE AWARD OF MAKEUP PARENTING TIME DUE TO COURT-CAUSED PREJUDICE
On 03/26/2025, this Court issued a correction acknowledging prior procedural errors that contributed to delays in Movant�s parenting time.
These delays were not caused by Movant but rather by court-recognized procedural failures and Respondent�s noncompliance.
As a direct result, Movant has suffered a significant and unjust loss of time with his child, which has harmed the parent-child relationship.
The Court has both the authority and the obligation to rectify this harm by awarding immediate and uninterrupted makeup parenting time.
Movant requests that the full amount of lost time be restored in an expedited manner.
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:
Order immediate makeup parenting time for the full amount of time lost due to court delays;
Set an expedited schedule for the makeup time; and
Grant any other relief the Court deems just and necessary.
III. MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST RESPONDENT FOR MISREPRESENTATION AND NONCOMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERS
The Court�s recent correction confirms that Respondent engaged in misrepresentation regarding the execution of prior orders.
Respondent�s deliberate mischaracterization of the Court�s directive resulted in an unjustified loss of Movant�s parenting time.
The Court has the inherent authority to sanction parties who act in bad faith and obstruct justice.
Movant requests that this Court impose appropriate sanctions, including but not limited to:
Monetary sanctions for attorney�s fees and costs incurred due to Respondent�s misrepresentation.
Compensatory sanctions in the form of additional parenting time beyond standard makeup time.
Judicial warnings or contempt findings to deter further misconduct.
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:
Issue sanctions against Respondent for bad faith conduct;
Award compensatory relief in the form of additional parenting time; and
Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.
IV. MOTION FOR SOLE CUSTODY, CHILD SUPPORT, AND LEGAL FEES
Given the documented history of Respondent�s noncompliance, obstruction, and misrepresentation, it is in the best interest of the minor child that Movant be awarded sole legal and physical custody.
Respondent has demonstrated a pattern of behavior that prioritizes obstruction over the well-being of the child, necessitating a change in custody.
Movant has provided a stable and supportive environment, and granting sole custody will ensure the child�s best interests are met.
Movant requests that Respondent be ordered to pay child support in accordance with statutory guidelines, retroactive to the date of initial filing.
Given Respondent�s bad faith conduct, Movant also seeks an award of legal fees incurred due to unnecessary litigation caused by Respondent�s actions.
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:
Award Movant sole legal and physical custody of the minor child;
Order Respondent to pay child support, retroactive to 1 year;
Award Movant all previous motions in full;
Order Respondent to pay Movant�s legal fees; and
Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

** Name ** MOTION TO SUBMIT EVIDENCE OF EVICTION DISMISSAL AS PROOF OF CONSPIRACY AND LACK OF LEGAL BASIS


MOTION TO SUBMIT EVIDENCE OF EVICTION DISMISSAL AS PROOF OF CONSPIRACY AND LACK OF LEGAL BASIS
NOW COMES Movant, Micheal Salmon, pro se, and respectfully submits into evidence the official court dismissal of the eviction action filed against him by Kelly Truelove, which directly undermines the opposing party�s claims regarding his living situation and exposes a pattern of conspiracy and bad faith litigation. In support of this motion, Movant states as follows:
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The basis for Counter-Respondent�s claims against Movant has been the false assertion that Movant�s living situation was unstable, a claim purportedly supported by an eviction proceeding initiated by Kelly Truelove.
On 03/21/2025, the eviction case filed by Kelly Truelove was officially dismissed.
This dismissal, occurring without an adjudication on the merits, demonstrates that the eviction claim itself was either legally unfounded or strategically abandoned, undermining any assertion that Movant�s residence was unstable or unsuitable for parenting time.
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION AND BAD FAITH
Counter-Respondent, through her attorney Josh Garrett, has relied on the purported eviction to bolster her case against Movant, despite lacking any valid legal foundation.
Attorney Josh Garrett has admitted to direct communication with Kelly Truelove regarding Movant�s residence, indicating a coordinated effort to fabricate instability in order to justify denying Movant custody rights.
The involvement of multiple parties in propagating this false narrative constitutes a deliberate conspiracy to prejudice Movant�s case through fraudulent claims and misuse of legal procedures.
This Court has a duty to recognize and act upon evidence of bad faith litigation tactics, particularly where such actions have materially impacted Movant�s parental rights and due process protections.
LEGAL ARGUMENT
The submission of evidence demonstrating fraud upon the court and coordinated deception is both relevant and necessary for the just resolution of this case.
Courts have an inherent authority to sanction parties who engage in bad faith litigation and to ensure that judgments are rendered based on factual and legal integrity rather than manufactured falsehoods.
The dismissal of the eviction action negates the sole argument advanced by Counter-Respondent regarding Movant�s alleged instability and further justifies the granting of full custody to Movant.
RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:
Accept the official dismissal of the eviction case as submitted evidence in the appeal and present case;
Recognize the coordinated effort to misrepresent Movant�s living situation and consider such actions in the Court�s final determinations;
Issue any necessary sanctions or corrective actions to address the bad faith conduct of Counter-Respondent and her counsel;
Grant any other relief this Court deems just and proper.

** Name ** Letter to Judge Selby


Dear Judge Selby,
I am submitting the official dismissal of the eviction case filed against me as evidence in my ongoing custody proceedings. This dismissal directly refutes the fabricated claims regarding my living situation�claims that have been used to justify the denial of my parental rights.
This Court has repeatedly delayed ruling on critical motions, allowing opposing counsel to advance demonstrably false narratives without consequence. The evidence now before you exposes coordinated misconduct between Counter-Respondent and her attorney, Josh Garrett, who actively conspired with the landlord to present a fraudulent basis for my alleged instability.
Given the gravity of this misconduct and its direct impact on my case, I request immediate acknowledgment of this evidence, proper rulings on all outstanding motions, and corrective action against those who have manipulated this Court�s proceedings. Any failure to act would constitute a knowing disregard for due process and the integrity of these proceedings.
I demand a formal, on-the-record response to these issues before my upcoming hearing and request that this letter be entered into the official record of these proceedings.

** Name ** NOTICE OF JUDICIAL OBSTRUCTION, DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS, & DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE RULING TO PREVENT FURTHER COURT MISCONDUCT


NOTICE OF JUDICIAL OBSTRUCTION, DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS, & DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE RULING TO PREVENT FURTHER COURT MISCONDUCT
Judge Matt Alan Selby,
This letter serves as formal notice of this Court�s continued failure to adhere to due process, enforce its own orders, and rule in accordance with the law. The record reflects that I, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, have been subjected to systematic judicial bias, manipulated narratives, and unjust rulings, despite overwhelming evidence in my favor.
This Court has engaged in a repeated pattern of the following misconduct:
Manipulating the Narrative in Hearings:
The Court dismissed clear and material evidence while allowing misrepresentations to stand uncontested, despite my corrections on the record.
The Court mischaracterized my legal arguments to justify an adverse ruling that contradicts both statutory law and precedent.
Ruling Against Me with Bias:
On multiple occasions, this Court has denied motions based not on their merit, but rather on procedural maneuvers that favor the opposing party.
The Court has refused to recognize and correct prior rulings that were based on false statements, even after those statements were disproven with objective evidence.
Ignoring Hard Evidence:
The Court has systematically disregarded documentary, testimonial, and procedural evidence that would otherwise mandate rulings in my favor.
Example: The Court upheld an order despite clear fraud in its foundation, ignoring my filed motions documenting the fraudulent nature of the evidence relied upon.
Penalizing Me for Correcting the Court�s Errors:
The record reflects instances where I have been penalized, not for any legal misconduct, but for pointing out the Court�s failure to properly consider the facts and law in this case.
Instead of correcting the record, the Court has resorted to procedural deflections and further delaying tactics.
MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT DUE TO JUDICIAL NONCOMPLIANCE & FAILURE TO RULE
COMES NOW, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court for an immediate default ruling in his favor due to the Court�s ongoing failure to adjudicate filed motions, enforce its own orders, and uphold due process. In support of this motion, Movant states as follows:
This Court has repeatedly failed to rule on numerous pending motions despite clear violations of law and due process.
The Respondent, Crycella Freitag, has now violated the Court�s own order from March 26, 2025, by refusing to allow uninterrupted scheduled phone calls and interfering with Movant�s communication with his son, intentionally, repetitively, and under direction to stop.
This marks the fourth time that Crycella has directly ignored a standing Court order without consequence, demonstrating a pattern of willful defiance.
The Court�s refusal to enforce its own orders, while simultaneously allowing Respondent to benefit from unlawful rulings, has resulted in an unfair and prejudicial legal process against Movant.
By failing to rule on critical motions and ignoring clear judicial misconduct, the Court is in direct violation of Movant�s constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.
The failure to rule has caused substantial harm to Movant, who remains deprived of his parental rights and subjected to judicial bias with no recourse.

** Date ** Mar 28, 2025
** Name ** NOTICE OF JUDICIAL NONCOMPLIANCE & OBSTRUCTION OF DUE PROCESS


NOTICE OF JUDICIAL NONCOMPLIANCE & OBSTRUCTION OF DUE PROCESS
COMES NOW, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this formal Notice of Judicial Noncompliance and Obstruction of Due Process, as this Court has engaged in an ongoing and deliberate pattern of failing to act in accordance with the law.
This Court has refused to rule on multiple critical motions that directly impact the fundamental rights of Movant and his child.
This Court has knowingly upheld fraudulent orders, despite having full awareness of their unlawful nature.
This Court has allowed Respondent, Crycella Freitag, to violate four separate court orders with complete impunity, including her most recent violation on March 26, 2025, when she unlawfully prevented Movant�s court-ordered phone calls with his son.
The judge presiding over this matter has intentionally delayed proceedings despite having open hearing dates available sooner, demonstrating an intentional strategy to obstruct justice.
This Court�s inaction serves no legal purpose except to harm Movant and further enable Respondent�s continued violations of the law.
By failing to rule on these matters, the Court is now engaging in judicial obstruction, violating Movant�s right to due process under both state and federal law.
Movant has exhausted all proper channels for relief, including filing a Writ of Mandamus, Motion to Disqualify, Motion for Judicial Notice of Fraud, and Request for Immediate Hearing�all of which this Court has deliberately ignored.
As such, Movant hereby places this Court on official notice that this continued refusal to act will be documented for appellate review, judicial oversight committees, and potential federal litigation under 42 U.S.C. � 1983 for due process violations.
DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION
I am not requesting a hearing, as the law is clear. I demand the following immediate relief:
An immediate ruling on all pending motions, without further delay.
An immediate default judgment in my favor, due to this Court�s failure to act and uphold the law.
A formal finding of contempt against Crycella Freitag and Josh Garrett for repeated violations of this Court�s orders.
A written justification for any further delay in ruling, to be entered into the case record for appellate review.

** Name ** RESPONSE TO OBJECTIONS

RESPONSE TO OBJECTIONS
Comes now Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and states the following in response to Petitioner�s objections:
Supervised visitation is unnecessary. The requirement was based on an unfair custody order that was issued on false premises. The underlying claims were dismissed without prejudice, and the order was imposed outside the proper jurisdiction.
Respondent�s objections are contradictory. Respondent claims none of the proposed providers offer supervision, yet admits at least two do but dismisses them due to distance. This contradicts the argument that no viable options exist and demonstrates obstruction rather than cooperation.
Respondent has continuously acted in bad faith to prevent my time with Felix. It has now been two months since I have been allowed to see my son, despite no valid legal justification for continued interference.
Wherefore, Respondent requests the Court immediately reinstate my parenting time and grant any further relief deemed just and proper.

** Date ** Mar 31, 2025
** Name ** EMERGENCY MOTION FOR ENFORCEMENT OF PARENTING TIME, CONTEMPT, AND IMMEDIATE RELIEF

I, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, as the Movant in the above-referenced case, formally submit this request for judicial review and immediate forwarding of this matter to the appellate court due to procedural irregularities and judicial obstruction that have severely impacted my ability to receive a fair and impartial hearing. In support of this request, I state the following:
Unaddressed Critical Evidence
The only remaining evidence being used against me is an edited video that has yet to be ruled on by this Court. The refusal to make a determination on this evidence directly impacts the integrity of this case and my ability to properly defend myself.
Ignored Emergency Motion for Charges
I filed an Emergency Motion for Charges, and various Subpoenas requesting phone records to expose illegal conversations between Kelly Truelove, Jozef Hanratty, Josh Garrett, and Crycella Freitag. This motion remains ignored, despite its clear relevance in establishing collusion and perjury within these proceedings.
Judicial Obstruction and Procedural Violations
The Court has consistently ignored my motions while granting those of the opposing party, allowing unchecked perjury, and failing to rule on critical evidence that would dismantle the basis for the custody determination.
The custody order itself is founded on documented collusion, conspiracy, and perjury�facts which this Court has been presented with repeatedly but refuses to address.
Additionally, the Court�s persistent refusal to allow me to properly present my case, prepare my arguments, and engage in meaningful hearings constitutes a severe violation of due process.

EMERGENCY MOTION FOR ENFORCEMENT OF PARENTING TIME, CONTEMPT, AND IMMEDIATE RELIEF
1. Background
1.1. This Court previously entered an order granting Movant specific parenting time, including scheduled in-person visits and video calls at designated times and locations.
1.2. Despite these explicit orders, Respondent has repeatedly and willfully violated the Court�s directive by denying Movant his rightful parenting time.
1.3. Most recently, Respondent again denied Movant his court-ordered parenting time this weekend, despite clear instructions from this Court.
2. Ongoing Emotional and Psychological Abuse of the Minor Child
2.1. During a recent video call, the minor child, Felix, exhibited extreme emotional distress, crying uncontrollably for the entire duration of the call.
2.2. Respondent has systematically taught the minor child to hang up on Movant over the past months, thereby actively facilitating alienation and destruction of the parent-child bond.
2.3. When the child was no longer able to disconnect the call, he became severely distressed, at which point Respondent physically struck the child multiple times in an attempt to force compliance.
2.4. Rather than comforting the child, Respondent escalated the situation, verbally reinforcing his distress and punishing him for expressing emotions.
2.5. This behavior demonstrates a deliberate effort to emotionally manipulate and alienate the minor child, causing severe psychological harm.
3. Contempt of Court and Request for Immediate Enforcement
3.1. Respondent�s repeated and blatant disregard for this Court�s orders constitutes willful contempt and justifies immediate court intervention.
3.2. The alienation, physical discipline, and emotional manipulation of the minor child must cease immediately, as these actions are abusive and cause irreparable harm to his well-being.
4. Emergency Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Court to:
Find Respondent in contempt of court for her repeated violations of court orders regarding parenting time and video calls;
Grant an immediate hearing to address these violations and impose appropriate sanctions on Respondent;
Order make-up parenting time for all missed sessions and ensure strict enforcement moving forward;
Suspend all video calls until such time that Respondent demonstrates a good faith effort to facilitate them without interference or emotional manipulation of the minor child;
Modify the current order to provide for immediate enforcement mechanisms to prevent further interference with parenting time, including law enforcement involvement if necessary;
Issue any other relief this Court deems just and necessary in the best interest of the minor child.
Wherefore, Respondent requests the Court immediately reinstate my custody and grant any further relief deemed just and proper.

** Date ** Mar 31, 2025
** Name ** PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION


PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
COMES NOW, Petitioner, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, proceeding pro se, and respectfully petitions this Court to issue a Writ of Prohibition preventing the Honorable Matt Alan Selby from exercising further jurisdiction over the underlying custody matter due to judicial bias, obstruction of justice, and persistent violations of due process. In support, Petitioner states as follows:
1. Jurisdiction and Legal Basis
1.1. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Prohibition under Article V, Section 4 of the Missouri Constitution and Missouri Rule 84.22 et seq., which allows for prohibition to prevent a lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or engaging in conduct that denies fundamental fairness.
1.2. A Writ of Prohibition is appropriate where a judge has exhibited bias, refused to rule on critical motions, obstructed justice, or failed to uphold legal procedures in a manner that irreparably harms the litigant�s rights.
1.3. Missouri case law supports the issuance of a Writ of Prohibition where a lower court acts in excess of its jurisdiction or engages in judicial misconduct (State ex rel. Riverside Joint Venture v. Missouri Gaming Comm�n, 969 S.W.2d 218, 222 (Mo. banc 1998)).
1.4. A court�s refusal to rule on motions and evidence constitutes a violation of due process and may be corrected via extraordinary writ (State ex rel. Teefey v. Bd. of Zoning Adjustment, 24 S.W.3d 681, 685 (Mo. banc 2000)).
2. Statement of Facts
2.1. Petitioner is the father of the minor child, Felix, and is currently engaged in a custody dispute before Judge Matt Alan Selby.
2.2. The court issued a temporary custody order based on alleged instability in Petitioner�s living conditions, which was later proven to be based on perjured statements and collusion involving Jozef Hanratty, Kelly Truelove, Crycella Freitag, The Layne Project, Carolyn Salmon, Amanda Freitag, Stephanie Reed and opposing counsel Josh Garrett.
2.3. The eviction lawsuit that was used as justification for the temporary custody order has since been dismissed, confirming that the allegations against Petitioner were false.
2.4. The only remaining evidence against Petitioner is an edited video that the court has refused to rule on, despite multiple requests for an evidentiary determination.
2.5. Petitioner filed an Emergency Motion for Charges last week, requesting a subpoena of Kelly Truelove�s phone records to expose illegal conversations with Jozef Hanratty, Josh Garrett, and Crycella Freitag. The court has ignored this motion entirely in violation of due process.
2.6. The history of judicial misconduct in this case began when opposing counsel Josh Garrett first introduced Jozef Hanratty as a witness. During those proceedings:
The judge returned Petitioner�s cell phone, which had been submitted as evidence, and refused to consider its contents.
The judge ended the hearing early because opposing counsel had to pick up his children, preventing a review of critical contract evidence regarding Petitioner�s tenancy.
When Petitioner formally submitted the contract evidence at the next hearing, the judge ignored it entirely.
During a subsequent hearing, Josh Garrett spoke with Kelly Truelove, who then confirmed Jozef Hanratty�s testimony and stated verbatim, "Kelly wants him out!", proving collusion.
Despite this clear evidence of coordination, Judge Selby explicitly stated that he would continue to accept their testimony, even though nothing had been filed to support their claims.
Two months later, an eviction notice was finally filed, yet it was immediately dismissed without prejudice, reinforcing the ongoing manipulation of the court system.
2.7. Judge Selby has engaged in a pattern of judicial misconduct, including:
Ignoring Petitioner�s motions while ruling on all motions in favor of the opposing party.
Failing to rule on key evidence, thereby depriving Petitioner of a fair hearing.
Cutting off Petitioner during hearings, preventing him from properly presenting his case.
Refusing to enforce court-ordered parenting time, thereby allowing ongoing parental alienation and emotional harm to the minor child.
Allowing perjury and documented collusion to dictate custody outcomes, violating fundamental fairness.
3. Legal Argument
3.1. Judge Selby�s actions constitute a violation of Petitioner�s due process rights under the Missouri Constitution and the U.S. Constitution.
3.2. The failure to rule on motions and evidence constitutes an abuse of discretion and a denial of Petitioner�s right to a fair trial.
3.3. Judicial bias and favoritism towards the opposing party render the proceedings fundamentally unfair, necessitating intervention by this Court.
3.4. A Writ of Prohibition is the only adequate remedy because Judge Selby�s continued involvement in the case irreparably harms Petitioner�s rights and denies him a fair opportunity to present his case.
3.5. Any further rulings by Judge Selby while this petition is pending would be ultra vires (beyond his legal authority) and subject to immediate appeal.
4. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
Issue a Writ of Prohibition preventing Judge Matt Alan Selby from exercising further jurisdiction over this case due to bias, obstruction of justice, and due process violations.
Order the case to be reassigned to a different judge who will impartially evaluate the evidence and rule on all outstanding motions.
Direct the lower court to immediately rule on all pending motions and address the credibility of the edited video evidence.
Issue an Order to Show Cause requiring Judge Selby to justify his actions before this Court.
Stay all further proceedings in the lower court until this petition is ruled upon.
Grant any further relief that this Court deems just and proper in the interest of justice.
Petitioner reserves all rights to seek additional legal remedies, including judicial complaints, bar complaints, and federal action under 42 U.S.C. � 1983 for due process violations should this Court decline to intervene.
