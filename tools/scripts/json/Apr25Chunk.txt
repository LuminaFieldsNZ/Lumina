** Name ** JUDICIAL NOTICE OF COURT FAILURE TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION ORDER


I am addressing the ongoing failure of this Court to enforce its own order regarding my psychological evaluation and the selective application of requirements that continue to benefit the Respondent.
I, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, was ordered to complete a psychological evaluation. When I was directed toward a racially biased white psychologist, I motioned for an alternative and provided two Black psychologists. The Court granted my motion, yet Respondent has failed to schedule the required evaluation. Despite this, I complied to the best of my ability by undergoing evaluations through two AI psychologists. The Court has failed to enforce its own ruling while allowing Respondent to evade compliance entirely.
Additionally, I requested a psychological evaluation for Respondent to ensure fairness, yet the Court has ignored this motion, continuing the pattern of bias. If the Court will not enforce this order against Respondent, she should be barred from making psychological claims or defenses at trial.
Instead of ruling on my motion to enforce compliance, the Court has chosen to delay all decisions by scheduling a last-minute hearing on April 4, 2025, lumping together all pending motions. However, this hearing has now been abruptly canceled without reason, further delaying justice and denying me my right to have these urgent matters addressed. The Court�s refusal to issue rulings while obstructing my ability to be heard is a clear procedural failure that only benefits Respondent at my expense.
Rather than addressing these issues, the Court appears focused on venue changes rather than issuing rulings. I request an immediate ruling enforcing Respondent�s compliance with the psychological evaluation order and sanctions for her failure to act. If the Court fails to enforce its order, Respondent must be barred from introducing psychological arguments in trial. The Court�s continued delay, along with the unjustified cancellation of scheduled proceedings, only compounds the procedural failures that have already prejudiced my case.
JUDICIAL NOTICE OF COURT FAILURE TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION ORDER
COMES NOW, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this Judicial Notice regarding the Court�s failure to enforce its own orders pertaining to psychological evaluations, stating as follows:
Pursuant to prior court orders, both parties were required to complete psychological evaluations.
Movant has fully complied, completing and submitting two AI-based psychological evaluations in February 2025.
Respondent was directed to schedule a psychological evaluation and was provided two Black psychologists for scheduling on March 18 2025 prior to this filing.

Verified Qualified Evaluators � Respondent now submits two verified professionals with the credentials and experience necessary for psychological evaluations relevant to this case:


Caleb M. Stephens, LMSW, LCSW � A licensed therapist based in Kansas City with extensive experience in trauma, family therapy, and psychological evaluations. Website: https://drcalebstephens.com.
Liz Davis, LPC � A licensed professional counselor in Kansas City with expertise in psychological assessments and therapy. Website: https://www.lizdavistherapy.com.

Respondent has failed to take any steps to complete the court-ordered evaluation, refusing to schedule with the provided professionals.
Movant filed a Motion to Enforce Compliance with the psychological evaluation order, which has been ignored by the Court, despite Respondent�s continued noncompliance.
The Court�s failure to enforce its order enables Respondent�s continued refusal to comply, creating an unfair and prejudicial imbalance in these proceedings.
The Court�s selective enforcement of its own directives demonstrates judicial bias and improper favor toward Respondent.
Movant requests an immediate ruling requiring Respondent�s compliance before trial or, in the alternative, barring Respondent from introducing any psychological arguments due to her failure to comply with the Court�s order.
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Issue an immediate ruling compelling Respondent�s compliance with the psychological evaluation order, with sanctions for continued refusal; or
B. Prohibit Respondent from presenting any psychological-based claims or defenses in trial due to her failure to comply; andC. Grant any further relief this Court deems just and proper.


** Date ** Apr 3, 2025
** Name ** OBJECTION TO CANCELLATION OF HEARING


OBJECTION TO CANCELLATION OF HEARING
COMES NOW the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully submits this formal objection to the cancellation of the scheduled hearing in the above-captioned case, and in support thereof states as follows:
Background: A hearing was duly scheduled for 04/04/2025, at which the Movant intended to present evidence, arguments, and motions relevant to the ongoing custody proceedings and related matters.


Cancellation of Hearing: On 04/03/2025, the Movant was notified that the scheduled hearing was cancelled. No prior notice or explanation regarding the cancellation was provided to the Movant, and this cancellation significantly disrupts the progress of the case.


Legal Basis for Objection: The Movant respectfully objects to the cancellation of the hearing, as it violates the Movant�s right to a timely hearing under applicable law. Additionally, the cancellation of the hearing without adequate justification undermines the Movant�s ability to pursue relief and obtain a fair resolution.


Impact of Cancellation: The cancellation of this hearing causes substantial prejudice to the Movant by delaying critical proceedings, including seeing Felix. The Movant has prepared for this hearing, including arranging necessary evidence, witnesses, and legal arguments, and as such, the cancellation imposes undue hardship and further delays the timely resolution of the case.


Request for Rescheduled Hearing: The Movant respectfully requests that this Court promptly reschedule the hearing at the earliest available date and allow the case to proceed without further undue delay. The Movant further requests that the Court consider the legal rights and interests at stake in this case, as well as the previous preparation and efforts made by the Movant to comply with the Court�s schedule.


WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:
a. Overrule the cancellation of the hearing;
 b. Reschedule the hearing for the earliest possible date; and
 c. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

** Name ** EMERGENCY MOTION TO STRIKE FABRICATED EVIDENCE, REMOVE PREJUDICIAL DOCKET ENTRIES, ACKNOWLEDGE PERJURY, AND ADDRESS UNLAWFUL TEMPORARY CUSTODY ORDER


It is now undeniable that this court has permitted, if not actively facilitated, perjury, fraud, and racially motivated bias against me. I am formally demanding that you immediately forward the following legal matters to the District Attorney for prosecution, as is your duty under Kansas law:
Perjury by Jozef Hanratty and Kelly Truelove, who knowingly provided false testimony regarding my residence, fabricating instability to justify depriving me of my parental rights.


Fraudulent Legal Conduct by Josh Garrett, who orchestrated the perjury, manipulated evidence, and intentionally suppressed exculpatory facts.


Illegal Temporary Custody Motion by Crycella Freitag, which was submitted without legal standing and in direct violation of jurisdictional law.


Judicial Misconduct, including the deliberate falsification of docket entries, acceptance of known perjury, and the court�s complicity in racial discrimination against me.


Tampering with Evidence, as an altered video was knowingly entered into the record to misrepresent my character and manipulate the court�s perception.


This is not a matter of discretion�it is a legal obligation. You are required to ensure that these violations are addressed and referred to the District Attorney:
Mark A. Dupree, Sr.
 District Attorney, Wyandotte County
 (913) 573-2851
EMERGENCY MOTION TO STRIKE FABRICATED EVIDENCE, REMOVE PREJUDICIAL DOCKET ENTRIES, ACKNOWLEDGE PERJURY, AND ADDRESS UNLAWFUL TEMPORARY CUSTODY ORDER
COMES NOW, Movant, MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, and moves this Court for immediate relief regarding egregious procedural misconduct, willful judicial bias, and multiple violations of due process. In support of this Motion, Movant states as follows:
I. STRIKING OF EDITED VIDEO SUBMISSION
The court has allowed the admission of an edited and misleading video into the record, clearly intended to distort the facts and prejudice the proceedings against Movant.
This video does not meet the evidentiary standards for authentication, completeness, or fairness as required under Missouri Rules of Evidence.
Movant demands that this tainted evidence be stricken from the record immediately, and that any decisions or considerations made based on its content be vacated as a violation of due process.
II. REMOVAL AND NOTATION OF PREJUDICIAL DOCKET ENTRIES
The docket entries contain statements that falsely frame Movant in a negative light, demonstrating clear and intentional bias by the Court.
These docket entries do not reflect actual proceedings or facts but instead serve as a tool to manufacture an unjustified narrative against Movant.
Movant demands that all prejudicial docket entries be struck and that an official notation be entered correcting these misrepresentations.
III. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF PERJURY IN COURT FILINGS
Respondent and her witnesses, including but not limited to Jozef Hanratty and Josh Garrett, have engaged in perjury, presenting knowingly false statements to the Court.
Specific instances of perjury include, but are not limited to:
False testimony regarding Movant�s living situation.
Fraudulent claims about financial hardship to deny Movant access to his child.
Collusion with third parties to present fabricated narratives contradicting verified facts.
Movant demands that the Court immediately address these acts of perjury and refer the matter to the appropriate authorities for criminal investigation.
IV. UNLAWFUL TEMPORARY CUSTODY ORDER MUST BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY
The Court has allowed the enforcement of a temporary custody order that is in clear violation of Missouri law, as it was issued based on procedurally defective motions that lacked legal standing and factual merit.
This order was obtained through fraudulent representations and should be voided immediately, with full custody reconsidered in favor of Movant based on the egregious conduct of the Respondent.
Furthermore, Movant demands that the Court justify why it has repeatedly ignored clear violations of law and due process, which has directly harmed both Movant and the minor child.
V. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Honorable Court:
Strike the altered video from the record and prohibit its use in any further proceedings.
Remove and formally correct prejudicial docket entries that misrepresent the facts.
Acknowledge perjury committed by Respondent and her witnesses and refer the matter to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
Immediately vacate the unlawful temporary custody order and reconsider custody arrangements based on verified evidence.
Grant any other relief this Court deems necessary and just to rectify these severe violations of due process and judicial integrity.

** Name ** MOTION TO ADDRESS MANIPULATION AND NONCOMPLIANCE REGARDING COURT-ORDERED PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION


MOTION TO ADDRESS MANIPULATION AND NONCOMPLIANCE REGARDING COURT-ORDERED PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION
COMES NOW, Movant, MICHEAL LAWRENCE SALMON, and moves this Court to acknowledge the Respondent�s and their counsel�s deliberate failure to comply with Court-ordered psychological evaluations, as well as the ongoing judicial bias and manipulation of this requirement to paint Movant in a false and negative light. In support thereof, Movant states as follows:
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On 12/13/2024, the Court granted a temporary custody order to Respondent based on the false premise that Movant had unstable living conditions. This was based on perjured testimony from Jozef Hanratty.
The Court explicitly stated that if Movant remained in his home beyond a week, it would prove Hanratty�s testimony was false.
Two weeks later, Movant was still in his home. The Court, instead of acknowledging this, asked Josh Garrett to confirm the claim, who falsely stated, "Kelly Truelove wants him out!"
Two months later, Kelly Truelove filed a fraudulent eviction lawsuit, which was immediately dismissed, confirming collusion between Respondent, her counsel, and their witnesses.
On 01/29/2025, Judge Selby continued to dismiss Movant�s evidence submissions while enabling perjury and parental alienation.
Instead of correcting this injustice, Judge Selby further prejudiced Movant by ordering a psychological evaluation while ignoring Movant�s December 16, 2024 request for Respondent to undergo the same evaluation.
Movant initially objected to the examiners provided by the Court due to their lack of experience with diverse families. On 02/26/2025, Movant filed a Motion to Object to Psychological Examiners.
On 03/11/2025, Judge Selby granted Movant�s motion to use alternative evaluators, and Movant promptly provided Respondent and her counsel with a list of two qualified Black psychologists.
Despite agreeing to set up the evaluation, opposing counsel engaged in a pattern of obstruction, refusing to schedule the evaluation while engaging in tactics designed to entrap Movant into admitting noncompliance.
Movant engaged in 36 documented email exchanges with opposing counsel, where Movant repeatedly clarified that they needed to schedule the court-ordered evaluation. Respondent and her counsel refused to do so while making sarcastic remarks and further manipulating the process.
The only evaluators suggested by opposing counsel were white psychologists, despite Movant clearly indicating their preference for an examiner with experience in diverse family dynamics.
The Court�s ongoing refusal to acknowledge this pattern of obstruction while allowing Respondent to feign compliance demonstrates judicial bias.
II. ARGUMENT
Respondent�s Failure to Comply: The Court ordered both parties to undergo psychological evaluations. Movant provided evaluators, yet Respondent has taken no action to comply.
Opposing Counsel�s Bad Faith Tactics: Instead of complying, opposing counsel engaged in deceptive tactics to manipulate the narrative and paint Movant as noncompliant.
Judicial Bias & Procedural Misconduct: The Court has ignored Movant�s motions and evidence submissions while continuously enabling Respondent�s noncompliance.
Due Process Violation: The Court has denied Movant due process by selectively enforcing orders to Movant�s detriment.
III. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests this Court to:
A. Issue an immediate ruling compelling Respondent to comply with the psychological evaluation order and schedule an appointment with one of the approved evaluators within seven (7) days. B. Sanction Respondent and her counsel for bad faith conduct and their deliberate attempts to obstruct compliance. C. Bar Respondent from introducing any psychological-based arguments or defenses at trial due to her failure to comply with the Court order. D. Acknowledge and correct the judicial bias demonstrated in the handling of this issue, ensuring future impartial enforcement of all court orders. E. Grant any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

Request for Remote Appearance
Given the challenges, Movant respectfully requests permission to attend the hearing remotely via WebEx. This will ensure that the hearing can proceed without delay while allowing Movant to fully participate without imposing significant personal and logistical hardships.

WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Court:
Grant Movant�s request to appear remotely via WebEx for the remaining hearings..
Provide Movant with the necessary WebEx link or instructions to join the hearings remotely.

** Name ** MOTION FOR NARRATIVE DOCKET ENTRIES AND PRESERVATION OF APPELLATE RECORD

MOTION FOR NARRATIVE DOCKET ENTRIES AND PRESERVATION OF APPELLATE RECORD
COMES NOW, Movant Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court for the inclusion of narrative docket entries and the preservation of a complete appellate record in the above-captioned matter. In support of this motion, Movant states as follows:
That Movant has made repeated good faith efforts to verify the status of filings, hearings, and judicial rulings in this matter, including contacting the Clerk’s Office and relevant personnel.
That on April 7, 2025, at approximately 8:08 am, Movant contacted the Clerk's Office to confirm the scheduled court hearing for April 9, 2025, at 9:00 AM and to verify the Court's awareness and review of recent emergency motions, including those filed during the week of March 25–April 1, 2025.
That despite proper filing, multiple emergency motions remain unacknowledged on the docket, and no rulings have been issued—particularly in relation to facts that contradict verified records in the Movant’s Kansas case.
That this delay, pattern of silence, and failure to address material filings constitutes not only obstruction of justice, but has hindered Movant’s ability to collect and preserve exculpatory evidence critical to the full and fair adjudication of this matter.
That the pattern of procedural irregularities, administrative resistance to access, and judicial inaction demonstrates an ongoing failure of this Court to protect Movant’s rights, and creates an unjust prejudice that will likely continue unless the record is preserved with full narrative documentation.
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:
Order the clerk to include a narrative record of all filings, inquiries, and communications made by the Movant related to this matter since March 25, 2025, including verification attempts regarding the judge’s review of emergency motions;
Confirm and record all pending motions yet to be ruled on as part of the official docket for appellate review;
Preserve all correspondence, hearing logs, and court call logs from April 1–April 9, 2025, to ensure an unbroken chain of procedural transparency for appellate scrutiny.

EMERGENCY MOTION REQUESTING A HEARING REGARDING MISREPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION
COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves the Court for an emergency hearing to address the false and misleading statements made regarding the psychological evaluation in this matter. In support of this motion, the Movant states as follows:
The psychological evaluation, a critical component in the determination of custody, has been misrepresented by the Respondent or their associates.

False statements regarding the results, the handling, or the nature of the psychological evaluation have been presented to the Court, either directly or through third parties, with the intent of influencing the outcome of the proceedings.

These misrepresentations have the potential to severely harm the Movant’s case and the best interests of the minor child, Felix , as they are designed to undermine the credibility of the Movant’s ability to provide appropriate care.

Movant seeks a prompt hearing to present evidence demonstrating the falsehoods and to ensure the Court has a full and accurate understanding of the psychological evaluation's actual contents and context.

WHEREFORE, the Movant respectfully requests that the Court grant this emergency motion and schedule a hearing at the Court’s earliest convenience to address the misrepresentations made regarding the psychological evaluation.


** Date ** Apr 9, 2025
** Name ** MOTION TO STRIKE UNILATERAL PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION AND REQUEST FOR COURT-APPOINTED NEUTRAL EVALUATOR

MOTION TO STRIKE UNILATERAL PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION AND REQUEST FOR COURT-APPOINTED NEUTRAL EVALUATOR
COMES NOW, Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and respectfully moves this Court to strike any outstanding order or implication requiring participation in a psychological evaluation conducted by Midtown Psychological Services, and in support thereof, states the following:

1. Procedural Background
On or about February 26, 2025, Movant was contacted by Midtown Psychological Services, stating they had been contacted by Sarah, an associate of the Garrett Law Firm, and had been assigned to conduct a psychological evaluation of Movant allegedly pursuant to a court order.
The provider confirmed the initial communication came solely from Respondent’s legal counsel, with no record of direct court appointment or oversight. Further, Respondent Crycella Freitag personally paid for the evaluation, a clear breach of neutrality and procedural integrity.
Movant immediately requested written clarification regarding the referral process, scope of evaluation, and the provider’s neutrality. No clarification or court confirmation was received.

2. Midtown Psychological Has Withdrawn
On April 9, 2025, Movant contacted Midtown Psychological Services. During this call, a representative from their office stated that Midtown Psychological has formally declined to be involved in this case and has requested that the Garrett Law Firm not contact their office again.
The provider’s withdrawal confirms that the original evaluation order was not arranged through a neutral process, but instead unilaterally initiated and funded by Respondent and her legal team.

3. Request for Court Relief
Movant is not opposed to participating in a psychological evaluation so long as it is:
Court-appointed through a neutral selection process, and
Conducted by an evaluator with no prior affiliation with either party.
In light of these developments, Movant respectfully requests that the Court:
Strike any evaluation order referencing Midtown Psychological or resulting from unilateral appointment by Respondent’s counsel.
Issue a new order appointing a neutral, court-selected evaluator, with costs split equitably or determined by the Court.

WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the relief requested above, strike the existing referral to Midtown Psychological Services, and appoint a neutral psychological evaluator in accordance with fair and impartial procedures.

** Date ** Apr 9, 2025
** Name ** EMERGENCY MOTION TO VACATE COURT-ORDERED PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION DUE TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND BAD FAITH

EMERGENCY MOTION TO VACATE COURT-ORDERED PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION DUE TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND BAD FAITH
COMES NOW Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and moves this Court to vacate its order requiring evaluation by Midtown Psychological Services ("Midtown") for the following reasons:
I. INTRODUCTION
The Court’s order conditioned any custody modification on Movant completing an evaluation with Midtown—a provider now unavailable due to their refusal to work with Respondent’s counsel (Garrett Law Firm) for ethical reasons.
Midtown’s rejection of Garrett Law Firm confirms:
The evaluation process was tainted by Respondent’s counsel’s misconduct.
The Court’s order is now impossible to comply with, as Midtown will not proceed.
The Court’s linkage of custody to this evaluation punishes Movant for Respondent’s counsel’s actions and violates due process.

II. LEGAL GROUNDS
A. The Evaluation Order is Void Due to Impossibility
MO Rule 68.01: Court-ordered evaluations must be neutral. Midtown’s withdrawal proves the process was compromised.
MO Supreme Court Precedent: Orders requiring impossible acts (e.g., evaluations with conflicted providers) are unenforceable (State ex rel. M.D.K., 445 S.W.3d 543 (Mo. App. 2014)).

B. The Garrett Law Firm’s Misconduct Invalided the Process
Midtown’s refusal to work with Garrett Law Firm after payment from Respondent confirms:
Ex parte coordination between Respondent’s counsel and the evaluator.
Financial bias (Respondent pre-paid Midtown before the order issued).

C. The Court’s Custody Condition is Retaliatory
The Court’s sole reason for denying modification was Movant’s non-compliance with Midtown’s evaluation—an evaluation now proven unethical.
Conditioning custody on a tainted evaluation violates fundamental fairness (In re Marriage of Denton, 169 S.W.3d 604 (Mo. App. 2005)).

III. RELIEF REQUESTED
Movant respectfully requests:
An order vacating the requirement to undergo evaluation with Midtown Psychological Services.
A finding that Respondent’s counsel’s actions rendered the evaluation process void ab initio.
Permission to seek an independent evaluator from a court-approved panel, with costs borne by Respondent due to her counsel’s misconduct.
An immediate hearing on custody modification, as the Court’s prior condition is now moot.
IV. CONCLUSION
The Court cannot enforce an order premised on an unethical, impossible act. Movant seeks justice untainted by Garrett Law Firm’s bad-faith tactics.

** Name ** NOTICE AND DEMAND FOR JUDICIAL CORRECTION

NOTICE AND DEMAND FOR JUDICIAL CORRECTION

COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this formal notice and demand for judicial correction in response to the Court's prior directive regarding the psychological evaluation at Midtown Psychological Associates, and the Court’s continued failure to issue rulings on properly filed and documented motions.
On the record during the hearing held on or about 4/9/2025 9:00am, the Honorable Judge Matt Alan Selby directly threatened the undersigned with contempt if he did not obtain a psychological evaluation specifically from Midtown Psychological Associates.

On the record during the hearing, Judge Selby threatened to end the hearing every time Movant tried to correct the record, or defend himself making it an impossible environment of recognized biased rulings.   

Movant has made every good faith effort to comply with this directive. However, Midtown Psychological Associates has explicitly refused to provide services due to their policy of not working with Garrett Law Firm, who represents Respondent. This makes compliance with the Court's directive factually and legally impossible.

Despite multiple filings and full documentation disproving every harmful allegation made against the Movant, the Court has failed to rule on any of Movant’s motions, and have not provided any future hearings without explanation or notice of rescheduling.

The Court’s refusal to acknowledge or correct its misdirected contempt threats and procedural errors has created a situation of ongoing prejudice, harm, and constitutional deprivation to Movant, who remains unable to exercise custodial rights due to this unresolved matter.

Each day this error is left uncorrected, it further compounds the damage to Movant’s legal position, personal stability, and most critically his relationship with the minor child.

There is currently no legal or factual justification for the continued separation of the minor child, Felix, from Movant. All previous allegations have been disproven or rendered moot, and yet no hearing is scheduled. This flagrant delay in justice and access to due process constitutes a continuing violation of Movant’s civil rights under color of state law, and may give rise to federal review or civil rights litigation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
Kelly Truelove played a critical role in validating false claims about Micheal’s housing stability during custody proceedings, despite lacking a direct rental agreement with him. Her decision to proceed with eviction efforts, combined with her refusal to clarify her communication boundaries and reliance on Jozef Hanratty’s authority, suggests possible coordination with Crycella Freitag and Josh Garrett. Given Josh Garrett's on-record statements attributing key information to Kelly, and her indirect influence on custody-related narratives, it is essential to subpoena all text message records between Kelly Truelove, Crycella Freitag, and Josh Garrett to determine the extent of collusion, perjury, or strategic misrepresentation intended to harm Micheal’s parental rights.
Additionally, the Court has failed to forward documented allegations against Jozef Hanratty to the appropriate prosecutorial authorities, despite multiple filings identifying three clear instances of perjury, committed knowingly and willfully during custody proceedings. The police previously issued a verbal warning to Mr. Hanratty regarding his involvement, yet he continued to inject himself into the litigation, materially influencing the case with demonstrable falsehoods. The Court's refusal to act or refer the matter to the District Attorney further obstructs the proper administration of justice and emboldens continued abuse of the legal process.
WHEREFORE, Movant demands immediate judicial correction of the record regarding the threatened contempt, psychological evaluation and the immediate scheduling of a hearing on the outstanding motions and issues.



** Date ** Apr 10, 2025
** Name ** EMERGENCY MOTION FOR JUDICIAL CORRECTION, HEARING REQUEST, AND SANCTIONS FOR MISREPRESENTATION OF COURT-ASSOCIATED PROVIDER

EMERGENCY MOTION FOR JUDICIAL CORRECTION, HEARING REQUEST, AND SANCTIONS FOR MISREPRESENTATION OF COURT-ASSOCIATED PROVIDER

COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, appearing pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to take immediate judicial corrective action and schedule an emergency hearing in light of ongoing violations of due process, false representations made by opposing counsel regarding third-party service providers, and the resulting deprivation of Movant’s custodial access. In support thereof, Movant states the following:

I. IMMEDIATE ISSUE: USE OF NON-EXISTENT ENTITY TO OBSTRUCT REUNIFICATION
The entity referred to as "KidCentric" has been referenced in prior discussions related to court-ordered services or evaluations in this case.
Upon investigation, there is no active or registered business operating under the name "KidCentric" in the State of Kansas. The only such entity was forfeited and administratively dissolved.
Movant was placed in a position of relying on this non-existent provider for crucial services affecting his custodial rights, including but not limited to visitation facilitation and psychological evaluation pathways.
This constitutes material misrepresentation by opposing counsel and/or a grave procedural error by the Court, as no party should be ordered or expected to comply with an order that references a defunct or non-operational entity.

II. EVALUATION PROVIDER IS REFUSING CONTACT DUE TO JOSH GARRETT
The Court additionally ordered Movant to obtain a psychological evaluation through Midtown Psychological Associates, and threatened contempt if he failed to comply.
Movant made every good faith effort to schedule said evaluation; however, Midtown Psychological Associates has explicitly refused to provide services due to their refusal to work with Garrett Law Firm, who represents Respondent.
This renders the evaluation directive legally and practically impossible to comply with, through no fault of the Movant.
Yet, Movant remains under the implied threat of contempt and suffers continued separation from his son, Felix, without legal basis.

III. COURT’S FAILURE TO SCHEDULE A HEARING OR RULE ON MOTIONS
The Court has failed to respond to or act upon multiple properly filed and time-sensitive emergency motions submitted by the Movant, including those requesting corrections, protective orders, and judicial review of procedural errors.
The Court has also removed all scheduled hearings without rescheduling or notice, leaving the Movant in a state of procedural limbo with no avenue to be heard and removed all phone contact allowing Movant no way to contact Felix.
This denial of access to the Court, coupled with the refusal to correct directives that are impossible to comply with, has resulted in a flagrant deprivation of Movant’s due process and parental rights under both the Missouri Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

IV. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MISCONDUCT BY OPPOSING COUNSEL
Opposing counsel, Josh Garrett, has made repeated misrepresentations to the Court and has leveraged false narratives—including the Layne Project cancellation and "KidCentric" mislabeling—to paint the Movant as unstable or non-compliant.
Mr. Garrett knowingly omitted exculpatory evidence showing that Crycella Freitag refused to pay for court-ordered visitation at Layne Project, and later used that cancellation to push for an unjustified psychological evaluation through a provider who now refuses contact with his firm.

This conduct constitutes bad faith litigation, obstruction, and possibly fraud upon the court, warranting sanctions and referral to the appropriate disciplinary body.

V. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests the following:
That the Court schedule an emergency hearing within seven (7) days to address the false representation of "KidCentric" and the impossibility of complying with the psychological evaluation order;
That the Court formally strike or correct any orders involving non-existent or defunct entities, and issue a revised evaluation directive through a neutral and available provider;
That the Court order immediate restoration of unsupervised parenting time until such time as lawful procedures are properly followed;
That the Court issue sanctions against Josh Garrett for misrepresentation, bad faith, and suppression of exculpatory evidence; and
That the Court provide immediate clarity regarding all outstanding motions and scheduling, so as to prevent further deprivation of Movant’s rights under color of law.

** Name ** NOTICE OF JUDICIAL INTERFERENCE

NOTICE OF JUDICIAL INTERFERENCE

On April 10, 2025, Movant submitted a motion formally notifying the Court of the procedural obstruction and illegitimacy surrounding the entity referred to as “KidCentric.” That same day, Movant placed two calls to the Stone County Clerk’s Office, both of which confirmed that the motion was received and that Judge Selby was made aware of its contents. Despite this, the Court took no action, offered no response, and allowed the issue to persist—further forcing Movant to pursue non-existent or unverifiable services, and continuing a pattern of disregard for Movant’s filings and due process rights.

** Name ** EMERGENCY MOTION TO STRIKE KIDCENTRIC FROM ALL COURT CONSIDERATIONS, HOLD OPPOSING COUNSEL ACCOUNTABLE, AND SET IMMEDIATE HEARING

EMERGENCY MOTION TO STRIKE KIDCENTRIC FROM ALL COURT CONSIDERATIONS, HOLD OPPOSING COUNSEL ACCOUNTABLE, AND SET IMMEDIATE HEARING

COMES NOW, the Movant, Micheal Lawrence Salmon, and submits this emergency motion for judicial correction and relief, and for the immediate scheduling of a hearing regarding the inclusion of “KidCentric” as a referenced entity in this case. Movant further seeks clarification, protection, and relief against continued procedural obstruction, as this provider has now been confirmed to be unregistered, unlicensed, and uncooperative—resulting in a complete denial of access to the minor child and violation of the Movant’s constitutional rights.

I. BACKGROUND AND COMMUNICATION RECORD
On April 10, 2025, Movant made a final effort to contact "KidCentric" after six prior failed attempts. A response was received from a personal cell phone (785-424-3700), identifying the speaker only as “Julie,” who claimed to be the director of KidCentric.


When Movant asked for formal business verification, license, or legal documentation of this provider’s standing, “Julie” refused to provide any such documentation, stating, quote, “You can find what you need online. I am not providing any physical documents to you.”


Upon being pressed for documentation or confirmation of the entity’s legitimacy, she threatened to block Movant and further stated, quote, “I will advise the court I will not be providing services for you,” without stating why or how.


Public records show no registered, active business under the name “KidCentric” in Kansas, and the only such business has been forfeited. No verifiable business license, EIN, or professional affiliation has been disclosed.


The interaction is consistent with fraudulent activity, or at a minimum, an unregulated service attempting to influence judicial proceedings without accountability, documentation, or transparency.



II. DUE PROCESS VIOLATION AND COMPLETE DENIAL OF ACCESS
The Court’s reliance on "KidCentric" or any affiliated actor has now resulted in a total shutdown of reunification and communication between Movant and the minor child.


This, in conjunction with Midtown Psychological Associates’ refusal to coordinate with Garrett Law Firm, has rendered all court-ordered options for compliance and parenting time functionally and legally impossible.


There is no court date set to resolve these critical issues, despite multiple emergency motions filed, and Movant is being denied access to his child based entirely on fabricated and unlawful third-party involvement.



III. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully requests the following:
That the Court issue an immediate order striking any reference to “KidCentric” or its alleged representatives from the record and from any future orders or considerations;

That the Court order an investigation into the nature of the service, including any statements made by “KidCentric” to the Court and whether they were initiated by or in coordination with opposing counsel;

That the Court schedule an emergency hearing within seven (7) days to review this obstruction, reset service provider arrangements through a neutral and verified party, and address the ongoing constitutional violations facing the Movant;

That opposing counsel be held accountable for presenting, supporting, or coordinating with non-licensed entities, and that sanctions be considered if the obstruction is found to be strategic or knowing;

That Movant’s access to his child be restored immediately or a pathway be established through legitimate and legally accountable channels, not fabricated or unverifiable third parties.
